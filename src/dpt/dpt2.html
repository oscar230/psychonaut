<P>For my first trip at Burning Man 99 I wanted to do something short acting. I wanted to open myself up, but at the same time take it easy on my first night out. I had a small amount of 5-MeO-DMT and some Salvia extract on hand. I had decided to smoke the 5-MeO-DMT when a friend came up and said he had some DPT freebase if I wanted to try it. I did indeed, so off to his dome we went to try it out.

<P>I'd done DPT once before, snorting the HCl powder. The trip had been all right, but I definitely had not liked snorting the material. I was very interested to see how the smoked experience would differ from the snorted trip.

<P>While we were preparing to launch, a voice from outside called out "Oh my god! Look up!  Look at the sky right now". I ran out to see what the commotion was all about. In the sky I saw one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. A shower of meteors (or something) was burning up as it streaked across the sky. It traveled for a minute, maybe more, receding in the distance and as it burned up. I took it as a powerful omen and went back inside to smoke the DPT.

<P>The pipe was prepared and handed to me. It was a small stone pipe with some DPT soaked parsley placed inside it. I smoked it in two or three small hits, but felt only threshold effects. I asked for a bit more, which was prepared and given  to me. I smoked it in two good hits and laid back as the effects vibrated into being.

<P>It came on slightly slower than DMT, giving me a moment to prepare. Behind my closed eyelids extremely colorful, abstract visuals flowered into being. These quickly became more complex and detailed, taking on symbolic aspects related to the bits of conversation I was overhearing. The content of the conversation didn't reach my conscious mind, but I definitely feel that what was being said and who was saying it influenced my visuals. The visuals were pretty intense, equal to a middle strength dose of LSD, but with their own character. These lasted for three to five minutes before slowly fading.

<P>As the visuals faded I opened my eyes and rejoined the rest of the room. I was still quite zoomed. Someone asked me how it was and I responded "Fineï¿½I liked it" or something along those lines. Everything in my visual field was shimmering a bit. About that time I suddenly got a strong taste of the material and nearly gagged. It was unspeakably foul. DMT is supposed to taste like burnt plastic, but this tasted oily, like some sort of nasty petrochemical. 

<P>As I sat in the back of the dome integrating I was getting occasional tastes of the material. Each time, I would sort of clench up. I was offered drinks of water, candy, etc to get the taste out of my mouth, but I felt like it was coming from inside me. It would go away and then come back all of the sudden. It was quite nasty.

<P>A friend (G) came in and asked if I were riding any spirit that night. I replied that I had just ridden a DPT spirit and quite liked it, except for the taste. We chatted about it for a few minutes. Other friends stopped by and poked their heads into the dome and I repeated basically the same conversations several times with different people.

<P>After twenty five or thirty minutes L asked if we could go exploring and I said sure. She had taken some Foxy (5-MeO-DIPT) around the same time I had smoked the DPT and she was starting to feel it. We walked around checking out the weirdness of Burning Man for a while. We stopped at a nearby rave camp and danced for a while. The DPT was still subtly present as a psychic warmth, a feeling of glowing alteration and a mild, pleasant euphoria. We walked past several neat camps, occasionally stopping to dance, talk or take a picture. 

<P>As we walked out towards the Man, L stopped and embraced me and thanked me for introducing her to the beautiful strangeness that is Burning Man. I felt an overwhelmingly pure burst of love for her and everything seemed right in the world. By the time we reached the Man itself I was at baseline, but still very, very happy.
