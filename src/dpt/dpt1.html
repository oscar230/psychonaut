<P>I recently came across a sample of an obscure tryptamine known as DPT. A fellow psychonaut had obtained a few grams for experimentation, and knowing my interest in novel compounds was nice enough to trade me enough for an experiment or two. I had originally planned on ingesting it orally, in a gel cap, but my research revealed that this method of administration was inefficient and unreliable. My other options were to insufflate (snort) it or to inject it. I am not a big fan of snorting, but needles turn me off even more, so I decided to go with the lesser of two evils. 

<P>Around 11:00 p.m. one night I prepared my material and myself for the experiment. I had heard that DPT complemented music well, so I put on some ambient (the Irresistible Force) to start me one my way. With a credit card I separated the fine powder into a few smallish lines. My plan was to insufflate them one at a time over the course of half an hour or so, stopping when I reached the level of inebriation I felt comfortable with.

<P>I snorted the first line and sat back to see what it would do to me. The snorting itself was uncomfortable and mildly painful, but what was worse was the drip down the back of my throat. I hadn't snorted anything since some cocaine and meth a few years ago during a very brief period of experimentation with those materials, but I remembered well the disgusting, bitter drip down the back of one's throat. This was among the worst I had ever had the misfortune to encounter. It was terribly bitter and it kept making me gag. I wasn't eager to snort more.

<P>I waited ten minutes before snorting the next line. This was about the same, but the drip continued to get worse. After ten minutes I felt fairly nauseated, and I was feeling a slight threshold effect of some type. I snorted the third line, waited five minutes, and then snorted the last line. This was between one third and one half of the roughly 250 mg I had started with, so my total dose was around 85-125 mg. 

<P>By now I felt distinctly altered. It was coming on pretty fast at this point. Things were starting to feel weird and I was definitely experiencing an altered state of consciousness. I felt sort of twitchy and uncomfortable. To make it worse, every few seconds I would get another taste of the bitter powder as it dripped down from my abused sinuses. The nausea was getting worse and it was starting to burn my throat. 

<P>I put on a different, more familiar CD and sat down on the couch in an attempt to get comfortable. I was still twitching, almost thrashing around. I felt like I could have restrained myself from moving but I didn't want to. In some weird way it helped me feel better. I have experienced similar twitches on mushrooms, mushrooms plus syrian rue, ayahuasca and smoked 5-MeO-DMT. I have come to call them tryptamine twitches, since they are different than the tremors I get from phenethylamine drugs and LSD.

<P>After I moved up to couch things began to be intense. The music sounded different, but not necessarily better. I felt a step removed from my surroundings. I was definitely altered. The room was beginning to strobe a little bit and colorful visuals began to crawl into the edges of my field of vision. If I hadn't been so uncomfortable (twitching and nausea, and that horrible bitter, burning drip) I think this part of the trip would have been very impressive and fairly enjoyable. Let me note this came on fast. After I did the final line I went from almost no effects to peak effects over the course of five or six minutes.

<P>After six minutes or so I knew I was going to puke. I grabbed the bucket I had prepared for this contingency and let loose. It was violent and intense. The contents of my stomach (chai and the remains of my dinner) forced themselves up my throat and through my mouth and nose. Usually when I puke I can keep it out of my nose, but this time that didn't work out. After I puked two or three times I felt much better.

<P>After puking it took me a few minutes to get into a comfortable state. I was still twitching a little bit and felt a little "off". I tried to focus on the music with mixed success. It sounded good, but I was unable to relax completely enough to get really into it. When the fourth song on the album came on I closed my eyes, curled up and just went with it. The music sounded incredible now, I was very into it, hearing all sorts of intricate things going on that I wasn't usually aware of. My mind rambled off, thinking about the band, the recording of the music, and a half a dozen other things. 

<P>I felt a vague sexual awareness and briefly wished that my girlfriend were present so I could explore that impulse properly. That desire passed quickly as I focused on the music and my interior world. Although the trip was fairly introspective it didn't produce any insight.

<P>I listened to the rest of the album that was playing, then put on some trance and did some dancing in my living room. By this time, the most intense part of the trip was over and I was left with a nice psychedelic glow, not too distinct but very pleasant and warm. I danced for fifteen or twenty minutes, concluding that DPT might make a fine dance drug. 

<P>At that time I decided to take some notes on the experience. I took a few minutes to jot down my thoughts on the experience so far. Afterwards, I was feeling social, so I got online and chatted with some friends for a couple of hours. During this period I smoked some good marijuana, finding that it sort of overlaid the remaining DPT high without synergizing or bringing it back much. After a few hours I headed to bed, slept well and felt fine the next day.

<P>The first part of the trip was very intense. There was some ego dissolution and I think that this drug has the potential to be an ego flattener. It has some of the same power and drama of DMT. It also has a somewhat negative body load. In terms of bodily discomfort, I would place it between mushrooms and ayahuasca (little worse than shrooms, not nearly as bad as ayahuasca). I will try it again, but not until I figure out a different way to administer it. Snorting it was just too unpleasant.
