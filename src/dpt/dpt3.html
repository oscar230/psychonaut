<P>After a week to recover from Burning Man I was ready to journey again. I was in the mood to try something fairly new, so I decided to finish off the small sample of DPT I had received many months before. The first time I'd tried it I had snorted it, which I found profoundly uncomfortable. I decided to take it dissolved in juice, a method several acquaintances had found to be effective.

<P>I dissolved approximately 170 mg of the light pink powder in a small glass of grapefruit juice. I had to stir it vigorously for several minutes to get it into solution. I started drinking this decoction at 1:00 am. The taste was moderately foul. It had a sort of oily, petrochemical type taste, much like the taste that pervaded my being after smoking the DPT freebase at Burning Man. As I drank the juice the taste became more unbearable and I had to add more juice. My stomach began to be a little funny as I sipped my psychedelic cocktail, so I ate a few crackers. By the time I finished most of the juice (80%-90%) I was feeling the first effects, a feeling of tightness around the eyes and a sense of altered awareness.

<P>As things began to happen I sat back and paid attention to the effects of the drug as they unfolded. Things built fairly rapidly from the first alert. I began to get mild trails off of moving objects. When I closed my eyes there were faint visuals there as well. I felt jittery and a bit ill at ease. My stomach was still funny. I decided to play some music 

<P>I put on the Soft Bulletin by the Flaming Lips. From the opening minutes I knew DPT was good for music. Like LSD I was able to hear more in the music than I am normally aware of. The sound was fuller and richer and the words seemed imbued with poetic import. I was able to go deeply into the music and it occupied the whole of my attention throughout most of the album. My ego was largely forgotten as I grooved along to the music. I closed my eyes several times to check the visuals. They were there, but faint and unreliable, not insistent in any way. I suspect this would be different with a higher dose.

<P>As the music played I decided to try a few balloons of nitrous oxide. The balloons and DPT synergized very well together. Each balloon I did seemed to dissolve my ego, launching me into a timeless space where all of history unfolded and kinked into itself to create this perfect moment called NOW. They were intensely visual and pleasurable while they lasted. Each balloon seemed to spawn thoughts of different people in my life and how they felt or might feel about nitrous. These little reveries were strange, funny and sometimes sad. 

<P>After the album ended I put on another of the Flaming Lip's albums and sat back on the couch. I was still tripping but seemed to already be over the peak. This was about two hours after I started drinking my DPT spiked juice, maybe a little longer. The music still sounded fantastic and I was still tripping, just not quite as hard. I remembered there was a very small amount of juice left in my glass and went ahead and finished it off.

<P>As I sat on my couch listening to music I wished L were there. This seems to be a common theme in my trips lately when I trip without her. Funny what love will do to you. This thought also reminded me that DPT was supposed to be excellent for sex. Being somewhat of an aficionado of psychedelic sex I was curious to check this out. Being alone, I figured I'd have to make do.

<P>Masturbation was intense and incredible. My fantasy was easy, there was a good degree of tactile enhancement and the orgasm exploded in a splash of jeweled colors. I can only conclude that DPT would be a spectacular sex enhancer, about equal to 2CB or LSD.

<P>I spent the remainder of the trip listening to music and just enjoying being mellow and trippy. I smoked some pot as the primary effects faded into a vague afterglow. The pot was nice and seemed to kick things back in a bit. After getting high I got on my computer and played for a while before heading to bed around 6:00 am.

<P>My third DPT trip was nice. It seems a promising entheogen overall. In particular it is nice having another short acting, relatively intense entheogen in the pharmacopoeia. However, the jitters and mild nausea are points in the negative column. Also negative is the fact that DPT is expensive. DPT is legal and available form several sources, but all of them come out to $20-$30 dollars a dose. For $20 dollars I can trip harder on mushrooms, LSD, or nearly anything else. I liked it and wouldn't hesitate to do it again, but with so many other things available and cheaper, it isn't anything I will go out of my way to seek out.
