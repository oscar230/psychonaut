        <h1>Diary of a Psychonaut FAQ</h1>
        <p>Although I haven't been exactly inundated with mail, I have recieved enough repeats on a few things to justify a FAQ. I will be updating this from time to time as I get more frequently asked questions.</p>
        <h2>Will you send/sell/give me drugs?</h2>
        <p>No. Absolutely not. I am NOT a drug dealer, nor do I have any desire to become one. Please do not send me any mail asking this question. Anyone who does will either recieve a copy of this FAQ or no response at all. I answer all my mail, but people who ask me for drugs REALLY irritate me and I may stop responding to these inquiries at all. This should be obvious, but apparently it isn't judging by the amount of mail I get asking me...</p>
        <h2>Do you want to buy drugs from me?</h2>
        <p>I am not interested in purchasing any legal or illegal substances from anyone who writes.</p>
        <h2>Wow! You have access to a lot of neat drugs. Where do you find them/how can I find them?</h2>
        <p>Anyone sensing a theme here? Anyway, I find the strange entheogens I explore the same way anyone else does. I look. And look. And look until I find them. Keep in mind this is my spirituality, my religion. I dedicate a fair amount of my time (and money) to researching and seeking out these agents of consciousness change. I looked for almost five years before finding DMT, for example. If you truly wish to explore the more exotic entheogens the only advice I can offer is "Seek and ye shall find". It may sound trite, but I have found that if the time is right, these things have a way of making themselves available.</p>
        <h2>Have you noticed any long term negative effects from your drug use? Do you worry about possible long term consequences?</h2>
        <p>I have not noticed any long term negative effects that I can attribute directly to my drug use. I am concerned about possible long term effects, as any reasonable psychonaut should be. The majority of my research indicates that most psychedelics have few or no long term health risks. The only exceptions I am aware of are MDMA and the dissociatives (DXM and Ketamine). Some but not all research indicates these substances can damage certain parts of the brain with excessive usage. Consequently I limit myself to infrequent usage of these materials and make an extra special effort to monitor their effects on my brain and body. If conclusive evidence of serious long term health consequences ever emerges for any drug I am using I would immediately discontinue its use.</p>
        <h2>Why haven't you answered my email/did you get my email?</h2>
        <p>I get a fair amount of mail regarding the site. In addition I lead a fairly busy life besides. And I tend to be a slacker. So, it routinely takes me weeks and even months to get around to answering my mail. I really do respond to all the email I receive that doesn't include a request for drugs. It just takes me a while. Please be patient and don't send follow ups asking "Did you get my email?"  If you sent it to the right address, I got it and will respond when I have a chance.</p>
        <h2>Should I try psychedelics?  Should I try a given psychedelic? I want to try psychedelics, what should I try?  What will happen if I try a given psychedelic?</h2>
        <p>I can't answer questions of this type. These sorts of decisions are intensely personal. Without knowing you I have no basis to form any opinion, much less offer any advice. If you are wondering which psychedelics are suitable for first experiences, I would say any of the commonly available substances (LSD, MDMA, mushrooms) will do. LSD and mushrooms will give you a better idea of what a "psychedelic" experience is, while MDMA is usually easier to navigate if one is concerned about the possibility of "bad trips". Salvia, 5-MeO-DMT and DMT are all probably bad choices for a first trip. These are often uncomfortably intense even for seasoned travelers.</p>
        <h2>What is your favorite psychedelic and why?</h2>
        <p>So many drugs, so little time. All of the psychedelics have their good and bad points. Some are more useful for certain things than others. Picking a favorite is not easy. All things considered, I would say mushrooms are my favorite. The mushroom experience has incredible depth and beauty. My mushroom experiences have been, overall, my most profound, impactful and moving trips.</p>
        <h2>Have you ever tried XXX drug?</h2>
        <p>For non psychedelic drugs, read down to Question: <i>What other drugs (besides psychedelics) have you tried/do you use?</i>. For any psychedelic drug, see the  <a href="triplist.html">trip list</a>. If it is listed there, I have tried it. Otherwise, I have not.</p>
        <h2>Why haven't you tried XXX drug?  Why haven't you done XXX more often?</h2>
        <p>For these two related questions the answer is almost always either a) lack of opportunity/access b) lack of interest or c) some combination of both of these.</p>
        <h2>What other drugs (besides psychedelics) have you tried/do you use?</h2>
        <p>In the past I have experimented with many drugs. The list includes - cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate (Ritalin), ephedrine, caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, GHB, codeine, percoset, nitrous oxide, opium and possibly one or two others. Currently I use caffeine and cannabis on a fairly regular basis. I do drink alcohol occasionally on a social basis, but almost never enough to get any noticeable effects from it.</p>
        <p>I haven't bothered to list non psychoactive drugs here. I doubt anyone cares what cold remedies and antibiotics I have used.</p>
        <h2>Would you publish some of my reports on your site?</h2>
        <p>No. Currently psychonaut.org is home to my reports only. Everything you read here is based on my own personal experience. I do occasionally like to read other's experiences, so if there is a report you would like to share feel free to email it to me. I won't publish it but I will read it. If you want to publish your reports, try Usenet, Erowid, the Lycaeum or just start your own site.</p>
        <h2>Will you link to my non commercial site?</h2>
        <p>Yes, if it is psychedelic drug related and well done. Just send me the URL.</p>
        <h2>Will you link to my commercial site?</h2>
        <p>For a variety of reasons I am currently not linking to any commercial sites that sell entheogenic materials of any kind.</p>
        <h2>Are you afraid of legal repercussions from your research/site/spiritual practice?</h2>
        <p>Yes and no. Since most of the tools I use are currently illegal it is entirely possible that could be arrested and punished for what I consider to be the pursuit of spiritual truth. This naturally concerns me. However, I live a fairly quiet life, I do not sell drugs and I am careful about who I choose to confide my interests in. I go to some trouble to keep this site anonymous and I feel that barring bad luck there is no reason I should ever come to the attention of the authorities.</p>
