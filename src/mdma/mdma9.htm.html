<P>Due to unfortunate weather conditions the first outdoor rave of the season was moved indoors.  The location they'd found at the last minute was less than ideal.  It was a paintball place, low ceilings, dirty and with a generally post-apocalyptic feel to it.  I decided within ten minutes of walking into the place that I didn't really want to take any LSD there.  I did want to trip, so I decided to try and locate some MDMA instead.

<P>I wandered around the place, talking to people and seeing what kinds of pills were available.  There was a surprisingly large array to be found, but everyone I talked to had just dropped and couldn't really give me any idea of how good their pills were.  I wandered around with my girlfriend L gathering info and waiting for the right pill to come my way.

<P>Before long I spotted a friend from another town that I don't get to see often.  I grabbed her and we began chatting.  Within minutes three other friends that had come with her appeared.  One of them, T, asked me if I wanted to take any MDMA.  I smiled and said, "I'd love to".  Off to his car we went.

<P>He gave me a capsule with 100 mg of pure MDMA in it, taking a slightly smaller amount himself.  This is only the second time I have known what dosage I was actually taking and whether or not it was pure. He had approximately another 100 mg left in a broken capsule, which he offered to split later as a booster. After I swallowed the capsule we smoked a one hitter of cannabis each and returned to the party.

<P>Inside we returned to the room we'd met up in, which was currently playing some old school house.  I started dancing.  The DJ was playing some really cool older stuff, including Kraftwerk, and I was having a really good time.  I wasn't feeling anything yet but a very slight high from the marijuana.

<P>After close to an hour I was only feeling a very slight, sub threshold effect.  It was a sort of "Maybe it is there..." thing.  I went and found T and asked if he was feeling anything yet.  He indicated he was, which reassured me.  We decided to walk back to the ambient room to see if we could find L.

<P>The ambient room was at the very back of the venue.  I did indeed find L there with a friend.  We sat down and started talking.  Another friend pointed out the presence of a guy I'd met at Burning Man (we'll call him J).  I started talking to him, asking him if he lived in the area, what he'd been up to since BM, etc.  As we started talking the ecstasy suddenly kicked in.  

<P>I went from almost zero to near peaking over the course of maybe ten minutes.  It was quite nice.  The conversation I was having, interesting to begin with, suddenly became fascinating.  I felt a warm glow emanating from my midsection.  I felt light and energetic and very happy.  I told T and L that I was now quite high. They both smiled and sort of laughed at me.

<P>I spent the next hour or two talking to L, J and several other people.  Most of the time we were sitting on a couch in the ambient room, but from time to time I would dance a little bit or we would walk around and check the place out.  The people I was with varied over the course of the evening as friends came and went, stopping by to say hello or goodbye or check on what was up in whatever room I was in.  I spent the better part of the night in the ambient room, with occasional trips to the first room I was in, the house/trance room.  

<P>My conversations were a lot of fun.  I just really enjoyed talking to people, finding out more about them, etc.  Nothing too deep or world shaking, just friendly conversation.  I felt very sensual as well.  At various times L would come by and rub my head or kiss me, setting off waves of intense pleasure.  She was candyflipping, her first time on that combo.  We both remarked at how great everything felt.  I rubbed her shoulders, reveling in how good it felt to touch another person.  T sat down in front of me and I rubbed his back as well.  At one point, while J and I were standing around chatting he gave me this huge hug that lasted for a minute or two.  It felt fantastic and I gladly returned it. As I have mentioned before, I find that MDMA allows me to relax enough to feel comfortable touching people more than I would otherwise.  I find this one of the most positive and useful aspects of the material.

<P>At approximately T+2 hours I noticed I was coming down a bit and decided to take T up on his offer of a booster.  I found him outside throwing a frisbee with a friend and asked him for the booster dose.  We split was left.  While we were sitting in his car, another friend of ours (R) came up to us.  She was just coming out to check on everyone, and since it was freezing out, she and I decided to return to the party.  While we were walking back I told her how cool I thought she was and how glad I was to know her.

<P>Back inside I returned to my previous activities, talking to my friends and enjoying the scene.  I wandered from room to room, sometimes with L or another of my friends, sometimes alone.  I felt wonderful, very pleased to be there and having a great time.  I had never tried boosting MDMA before, but the results were very positive.  I didn't get any higher, just continued the peak for another two hours or so.  There didn't seem to be much increase in side effects (jaw clench, eye wiggle, etc).

<P>Around dawn (6:00 a.m. maybe?) we decided to leave.  L and I headed back to her house.  I smoked a little bit of kind bud and we relaxed and talked for a while.  An hour or so after getting home we had sex.  The sex was good but I was unable to achieve orgasm, most likely due to the residual effects of the ecstasy.  Afterwards I fell asleep and slept fine, though not long.  The next day I was tired, but not markedly so.  

<P>This was a good trip.  I have noticed a tendency for the details of my MDMA experiences to escape me, leaving me with just a sort of warm and fuzzy recall of the experience.  I don't think this is necessarily negative, since the ecstasy experience seems more focused on emotions and feeling than intellect and thoughts.  However, it does indicate that in cases where MDMA facilitates an insight, it might be a very good idea to do something to cement the insight in your mind immediately, rather than assuming it will stay with you.  This is true to varying degrees for most psychedelics, but seems especially true of ecstasy.
