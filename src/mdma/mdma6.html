<P>After a couple of weeks off from both psychedelics and raving I was ready to get out again and continue my explorations of this mode of expression. I decided to try taking ecstasy again, possibly in conjunction with acid. I had just started a vacation and was ready to unwind and enjoy myself with some good friends.

<P>We arrived at the venue (a place we'd all been too many times before) and headed down to the front to stake out a place. I hung out and checked out the scene for a while before deciding to take my pill. I bought some water and swallowed the dose of ecstasy I had purchased.

<P>It came on fairly quickly. Within twenty minutes or so I was feeling the first sensations. The first alert I had was easiness in breathing. This familiar indicator of the ecstasy state brought with it a good feeling of anticipation.

<P>I was dancing as it became more apparent. I didn't feel quite as liquid and smooth as I had the last time I had tried ecstasy at a party, but I did feel quite comfortable. I began feeling quite happy and experienced a surge of love for the people I was with. I walked over to where one of them was sitting and gave her a big hug. She hugged me back and then gave me a backrub. As usual, backrubs on E are quite nice.

<P>Throughout the evening I was quite demonstrative, telling my friends how glad I was to know them and how much I enjoyed hanging out with them, hugging them, complimenting them, etc. I felt very close to and glad to be with my friends and was happy to tell them so.

<P>I was also friendly to the people I met. One guy next to me talked to me on and off all night. If I had been sober or on acid, I think I would have found him a little annoying, but in the ecstasy mindstate I was receptive and willing to talk to him indefinitely.

<P>Dancing was fun, but it didn't "click" to the same degree that it had the last time. The DJs were all first rate and dancing felt fantastic. I was grinning ear to ear, having a wonderful time. I felt relaxed, confident and happy.

<P>The peak came on strong, almost overwhelming. I was sweating quite a bit. I had to sit down for fifteen or twenty minutes to get my equilibrium. The feeling was a little different form other ecstasy trips I've had, heavier and somehow "dopey". It didn't cloud my thinking at all, as I still felt clear, but it did slow me down a bit. I felt alternately energized and enervated. After this short period of "heaviness" it seemed like a typical ecstasy trip, though not quite as "warm and fuzzy" as most previous trips. Because of the slightly atypical feelings, I wonder if it was cut with something strange, or perhaps not MDMA at all, but something else entirely.

<P>Three hours into it I decided to go ahead and take acid. Most of the people I talked to about candyflipping indicated that they preferred to take the acid after the peak of the ecstasy trip, resulting in a prolonged ecstasy type high with some visuals. I was interested to see if this would be the case, since my previous acid and ecstasy combination where I took the acid first, followed an hour later by the E had been a strange synergistic trip, different than either acid or E, in some ways superior to both.

<P>I took a single hit and continued to dance and enjoy the party. It came on almost imperceptibly. I did notice that everything seemed to sort of glisten and glow with an inner light. The visuals never got much more intense than that and a slight intensification of color depth. 

<P>It mainly seemed to prop up my roll, extending it while changing the flavor only slightly. It did seem to spread the trip out a bit into a deeper, more "cosmic" dimension, in contrast to the very grounded, interpersonally driven ecstasy trip. It only intensified my interest and pleasure in dancing. I became very tuned in to my body and able to visualize what I was going to do in my head before I did it. 

<P>Throughout the night, both before and after I took the acid I was enjoying watching other people dance. It's really interesting to see people getting into the music and moving their bodies in similar but subtly different ways. People seem to express different aspects of their personalities in their interpretations of the same basic movements. Some of the better dancers are simply awesome, able to move their bodies in seemingly impossible ways and move imaginary objects through space.

<P>Throughout the night I talked to my friends fairly constantly. Ecstasy usually makes me very talkative. I was in a wonderful mood all night. When the place shut down at 5:00 a.m. I was still zooming slightly, but off the strongest part of the trip. We headed to one of my companion's homes where we sat around talking about dancing, music and whatever else came to mind. We ended up going home around 10:00 a.m. and I didn't go to bed until afternoon. 

<P>I really liked this trip. It was a great time and I felt really close to my friends. I really enjoyed spending the trip with them, and I think we are closer for it. It deepened my existing appreciation of them and of our relationship. In comparison with my last candyflip it was interestingly different. This was more of a longer, slightly deeper and more visual E trip, whereas the first trip was a very different synergy between the two, distinct from both. 

<P>There are a multitude of factors that could account for the differences including differing order of ingestion, relative strengths of the doses of each drug involved, different "cuts" or substitutions in the ecstasy I used, etc. Hopefully further experiments will lead to more information on how to maximize the possibilities of this combination.
