<P>To celebrate the coming of the New Year, my friends and I went out to a huge rave.  Over the past year I had become more and more interested in and involved with the rave scene, so it seemed the obvious thing to do for New Year's.  I figured it was a good time to try something new as well, and decided that I would trip on Ecstasy plus 2CB.

<P>We arrived at the party around 11:30.  At that time I took a capsule of X that I had been saving for a while. I was with my new girlfriend and some friends of hers. My usual crew was coming down separately and I was going to meet them inside. After a short wait we made it inside the venue.

<P>I wandered around looking for people I knew for a while.  I ran into my roommate and some other people I know from parties.  I was eagerly awaiting the onset of the ecstasy I had taken.  It seemed to be taking a long time to come on.  Before long I began wondering if it was weak.  Then I began wondering if it was just bunk.  I had a couple of "maybe" alerts, but it never developed and it could very well have been all placebo.  After an hour and a half I was pretty damn sure I had been ripped off.  This irritated me, but I wasn't going to let it ruin my evening.  Like a proper boy scout I had come prepared.  Just before 1:30 a.m. I took a second pill that I had brought with me as a "just in case".  It always pays to be prepared.  

<P>About the time I took the second pill (which I knew to be good) the main performer came on.  This was the incredibly weird, incomparable live p.a. known as Rabbit in the Moon.  As the ecstasy began working (and it kicked in fast) they began doing their thing.  Strange noise poured out of the speakers and the video screens to either side of the stage displayed bizarre images.  I was thoroughly engrossed.  It was very intense.  

<P>My girlfriend (we'll call her L) asked if we could step outside to get a breath a fresh air.  While we were gone Rabbit in the Moon had thrown out thousands of glow necklaces and the crowd was a big wash of chemoluminescence.  It was very beautiful.  We returned to where our friends were gathered to enjoy the rest of the show.  

<P>The ecstasy was coming on strong.  I had to sit down as it began ramping up in earnest.  This trip and the one before it (which was the same type of pill) had a slightly different feel than most of my other ecstasy experiences. They both had a kind of dopey, heavy feeling coming up.  Both times I had to sit down to get my equilibrium during the come on.  Other than that they seemed fairly typical, if perhaps not as "warm" as some of my past ecstasy trips.  They did have the desirable empathogenic qualities of MDMA, but it seemed less demanding, less "in your face".  It makes me wonder if they were either cut with something odd, or not MDMA at all, but something similar (MDA? MDE? Who knows?).

<P>Rabbit in the Moon was making all sorts of spectacular noise, but very little of it was danceable.  I didn't mind too much as I was really enjoying watching their bizarre visual presentation.  Even more than that, I was enjoying being close to and sharing space with L.  We had only been dating a few weeks and this was our first trip together.  It felt really wonderful to have someone to touch and hold and be affectionate with while in the grip of the ecstasy.  She had taken ecstasy herself, and we were both very affectionate and cuddly.

<P>After the ecstasy had stabilized (maybe an hour and ten minutes into the trip) I decided to take my 2CB.  We went outside where there was more light and I took the 15 mg that I had brought with me.  Afterwards we returned inside.  

<P>I decided I wanted some Vicks and left to look for some.  I wandered around asking if anyone had a spare mask.  Of course, no one did, but most people were kind enough to give me a few inhalations off of their mask.  Inhaling the Vicks Vapor rub from a mask on ecstasy is an interesting experience.  It seems to open up your lungs, allowing more oxygen in.  It feels very nice, and after a few deep inhalations I get a nice head rush.  I'm curious how this was discovered, as it doesn't seem like the kind of thing that would just occur to someone.  

<P>As I wandered around looking for Vicks I ran into a few people I knew and made a few new acquaintances. One guy I met a while back asked me for a backrub, which I was happy to give him.  I chatted with some other acquaintances about various topics, mostly rave related.  As usual, the ecstasy made me very talkative.  

<P>After a bit I headed back to where L was.  She seemed very glad to see me.  By now another DJ was on.  He was spinning some good stuff and I danced a little bit.  It felt nice, but I couldn't really get into it.  I was more interested in talking to, touching and kissing L.  Luckily, she was all right with that, so we spent most of our time doing that exact thing.  The 2CB was starting to work, adding a nice psychedelic visual glow to the scene.  When I closed my eyes, the visuals were much more apparent, moving and winding and kinking around themselves.

<P>L and I decided to walk around for a while.  We went outside briefly, but it was damn cold.  We wandered up to the second level and sat down to chill and observe the scene around us.  We were both in a really good mood.  I was talking a mile a minute about everything and anything.  L seemed amused by me.  We were both very touchy.  We spent a lot of time kissing.  

<P>I had never kissed anyone on ecstasy before.  It is quite lovely.  Before I had taken the bees, it was an intensely pleasurable tactile experience.  After I took the bees it was even nicer physically, and it sparked intensely bright and convoluted visuals on my closed eyelids.  I could have sat there and kissed her all night.  She apparently felt the same way because that is more or less what we did for the next hour or so.  

<P>After a while we went back downstairs and rejoined her friends.  This was maybe five hours after I took the real ecstasy.  I was still going, but was definitely on the tail end.  She was coming off her roll.  I was exhausted physically, even though I hadn't danced nearly as much as I usually do.  We sat around and watched people dance and talked about the evening and our trips and whatever else came to mind.  

<P>A little while later we decided to leave.  We went home and smoked some low grade dope.  I was still a little zoomed off my bees and E, and the whole package mixed to make an interesting state of consciousness.  We went to bed and talked for a few hours.  Around 9:00 a.m. we had sex, but I was unable to reach orgasm.  I am not sure if the drugs or sheer exhaustion were to blame.  Either way, we went to sleep soon afterward and spent most of the day in bed.  

<P>Another superb trip and a great way to start the year.  I have to say that 2CB plus ecstasy is very nice, although it didn't live up to my expectations.  That may have been because of the quality of the ecstasy I took, which may or may not have been MDMA, plus other unknown substances.  

<P>The best part of the trip was the chance to really feel close to someone.  The ecstasy made it a lot easier for me to open up.  L and I both feel that our relationship was deepened by our shared experience.  One thing in particular I remember was the distinct feeling that I was with exactly who I wanted to be with.  I remember looking around at all the girls there, many of who were quite attractive and realizing that I had exactly whom I wanted.  Again I found that ecstasy seemed to bring about a state of emotional clarity.  It is a very nice state of mind and immensely useful.  Only time will tell if the closeness we achieved will be made lasting and real, but it felt wonderful and authentic.

<P>Having said that it will probably be a while before I try it again.  Concerns about purity, expense and the limited nature of the experience all make me feel that MDMA is best used only occasionally. I will certainly do it again, and will most likely "check in" with that state of mind from time to time as long as I use entheogens, but it just isn't something I feel is worthwhile to pursue on a regular basis.
