<P>After work, after meditation I decided to smoke 5-MeO one night.  It had been a while since I had tried it.  It had been a little while since my last major trip and I knew it might be longer still until I tripped again.  It seemed like a good time for a 5-MeO trip, which is quick, intense and undoubtedly psychedelic.  As an added bonus I hoped the stress relieving aspects it sometimes has would come into to play, helping me to relax and enjoy my evening.

<P>I loaded and smoked a small hit.  The white vapor puffed into the pipe and into my lungs.  Almost at once I started to salivate as the chemical began diffusing into my blood through my lungs.  I held it a good twenty seconds before exhaling, shuddering as I did so.

<P>The room immediately started vibrating and I knew I had a good hit.  I closed my eyes and was rewarded by lovely visuals.  MeO isn't always particularly visual and it usually isn't colorful even when it is, but this time it was both.  Behind my eyes abstract bands of light with colorful edges tunneled through the darkness, creating abstract shapes that almost resolved themselves into recognizable objects.  These visuals were as intense, though different in character, as some of my higher dose acid trips.  

<P>I remained still with my eyes closed, focused entirely on my inner state.  I felt a sense of happiness, peace and unity with being.  It was a wonderful trip, one of my most positive 5-MeO experiences, though on a mostly aesthetic level.

<P>As it was wearing off my roommate arrived home.  I walked into the living room to talk to him.  He handed me a bong and I took a hit of kind bud.  A few more hits and I was quite stoned.  I retained a nice trippy energy and positive glow from the 5-MeO-DMT, but I wouldn't say the cannabis was particularly intensified or altered significantly.  Perhaps if I smoked 5-MeO-DMT while I was already stoned it would prove more interesting.
