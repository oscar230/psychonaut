<P>After some months of not using 5-MeO-DMT I again felt its powerful call.  I had just obtained a new device for vaporizing this substance that promised to be even more efficient than my previous techniques.  The new pipe was like a small bubble with a hole at the top and a stem that came out of the side, near the top.  The stem had a small jig in it.  This has been referred to as a "classic freebase pipe" in literature I have read and the person who gifted it to me assured me that it was made in the seventies and had never been used.

<P>I weighed out approximately 30 mg on my relatively inaccurate balance, then split that in half.  I loaded a little over two thirds of the total in the pipe through the hole in the top.  I could tell just by looking at it that it was more than I had ever smoked before.  It was probably around 10 mg, give or take a few milligrams.  

<P>I went into my bedroom and closed the door.  I took a few minutes to calm and center myself by doing a breathing exercise and considering my intention.  This would be my first psychedelic trip since my overly intense LSD near meltdown nearly two weeks before.  I hoped it would prove to be a fruitful reentry into the psychedelic universe.

<P>I held a flame underneath the pipe until the powder melted and began to change into a thick white vapor.  As it vaporized I began slowly drawing it into my lungs.  The vapor was plentiful and as my lungs filled up the room was already vibrating itself into a higher energetic state.  I had just enough time to set the pipe down and lay down before the universe exploded.

<P>My reality twisted itself into a beautiful DNA like structure before exploding into a multitude of infinite possibilities.  Every thought I had held in the past week was sorted through my turbocharged brain as I accelerated to the edge of infinity.  As I reached that edge that cannot be reached everything melted into an oceanic wave of light and blissful peace that lasted an eternal second.

<P>Everything was perfect, forever.  I was feeling the love of the universe for every thing it contained.  I experienced the Master's consciousness as we melded and recognized our self.  Each moment of time condensed into a perfect teardrop on the face of the Buddha and as it ran down his cheek my ego reformed, leaving me in breathless awe of the beauty and complexity of this perfect work of art we affectionately call manifest reality.

<P>I lay in bed, still tripping hard as reality reformed about my newly born ego.  I heard my roommate leave the house and had a moment of regret, as I had wanted to talk to him.  I thought about my fiancï¿½e, at work and my daughter asleep in the next room.  I thought of all the people in my life that I love and respect and how much they all mean to me.  

<P>I got up and walked into the next room to kiss my daughter and then into the kitchen to look out the window and see if my roommate's car was till there.  I saw it was and knew he would be back soon and I would have a chance to talk to him.  

<P>I decided to walk outside and look at the sky as I came down from the intense afterglow of the 5-MeO-DMT.  I sat under the starry sky and reflected on the beauty I had just witnessed and how it related to my everyday life. I managed to hold onto the essence of it as the details slipped away with the remainder of 5-MeO-DMT that had saturated my brain.

<P>As I sat outside I had some physical aftereffects.  I was experiencing energy tremors or twitches in my legs, my lips were numb and I had an unpleasant plastic taste in my mouth and throat. All of it was insignificant in the face of what I had experienced.

<P>I returned inside as I became chilled and prepared myself a meal of soup and crackers.  As I was finishing my roommate came home.  We sat and talked for a while, drank a beer and then went to our respective rooms to sleep.

<P>This was a powerful trip, one of the best and most intense I have had with 5-MeO-DMT.  The new pipe and smoking method proved to be the most effective yet, as I had hoped.  It is definitely much easier to smoke, as there is nowhere for the material to escape to.  With both of my old pipes it had a tendency to run down the stem as it melted, making it hard to get most of the material, or to get burnt, wasting much of it.  This method easily prevents both of those problems.  It promises to bring me many more intense trips soon.
