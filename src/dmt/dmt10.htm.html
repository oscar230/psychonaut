<P>One Sunday evening before bed I decided to try 5-MeO-DMT.  I'd had a wonderful acid trip two days before, my weekend had been pretty nice overall and I felt up for some exploration.  I got my pipe ready, loaded a hit and prepared to smoke it.

<P>I slowly melted and then vaporized the material, inhaling it in one big hit and holding it deep within my lungs.  I set down the pipe, lay back and waited.  Within a few seconds I was feeling the influx of energy that marks the onset of 5-MeO.  I held it a few seconds longer before exhaling.

<P>My vision seemed to take on multiple levels, a perception that is becoming very common on my 5-MeO journeys.  It's like being able to see different states of energy present in things, like I am seeing the astral or ethereal bodies of material things.  Whatever causes it, regardless of what it "really" is, it is very interesting to look at.  In addition to this perception I was also seeing beautiful, lightning like colored flashes in the air.

<P>My hearing and sense of touch seemed to be likewise enhanced to an almost inhuman degree.  It seemed I was aware of every noise, every rustle, squeak and grumble going on in the room.  In particular, my body was making some interesting noises.  Everything I touched seemed to transmit streams of information to my brain.

<P>After a few minutes I was down and feeling wonderful.  I decided to load and smoke another hit.  This hit was equal to the first, again catapulting me into a highly charged, energetic state of consciousness.  My mind ran through the events of the weekend, touching on my acid trip, the girl I met, the ride home and thousands of other things.  Before long I was back again, smiling and feeling great.  Remembering my last 5-MeO trip, I decided to keep going and smoke another hit.

<P>This time I found myself in a perfectly peaceful dimension made up entirely of a black and white checkerboard type pattern that rippled and folded its edges into itself.  It was a strange and stark vision, but very lovely, and as I said, I had the most profound and warm feeling of peace from it. This lasted for maybe four minutes.

<P>Coming back I decided to push my limits and try two more hits, for a total of five.  Both of those hits were nice and put me into a similar place.  None of the five were as awe inspiring as most of my previous experiences, but they were all very pleasant and in some way enlightening.  As I have said before, 5-MeO seems to be a key to a very basic level of perception or being, a sort of cosmic consciousness.  While deep within its realm I feel like I am touching the very core of being, like I am jacked into the engine that runs the universe.  After smoking it I always feel a profound sense of well being and peace.  These trips were no exception.

<P>I noticed little or no tolerance from one hit to the next.  Each time I smoked an eyeballed amount, all roughly equal as far as I could tell.  All the experiences were of a similar intensity level, each lasting from three to seven minutes.  After this three to seven minute trip there is still a residual high, but rather than letting it trail off I chose to boost it with another hit.  After my five jumps I was able to sleep without trouble and awoke feeling great.
