<P>Late one night I decided to smoke some 5-MeO-DMT. I had been planning on tripping that night at a rave, but circumstances intervened as the party was shut down. It was around 4:00 a.m. when I arrived home. I still felt the need to explore mindspace, but I didn't have the energy to start a trip that late. It occurred to me that it might be an opportune time to try another experiment with 5-MeO and music. It only took me a few minutes to get everything prepared and start.

<P>I loaded and smoked a decent sized hit. I had a single candle burning for illumination. I was wearing stereo headphones and had my CD player cued up to play the song Upwards at 45 Degrees by Julian Cope. As in my last experience listening to music while smoking 5-MeO I felt enveloped by, defined by and driven by the music. It sort of became my reality. In a way it served to ground me, since I didn't go as completely cosmic as I do when using 5-MeO without musical stimulation, but in another way it served to push the experience into another direction and to another level. There is much to be explored here.

<P>After that song ended I loaded up another hit for the song Necropolis. As impressive as the first song was, Necropolis blew it away. I believe I did a bigger hit the second time. My being stretched to the breaking point. It was almost too intense. A few years ago I had had a similar experience while listening to the same song on LSD. I had equated that experience to a sustained full body orgasm. On that occasion I'd had to stop the music and remove the headphones, as the intensity became overwhelming. This experience was more intense, but I have learned to relax into my experiences to a greater degree since then.

<P>My body was contorted and not entirely comfortable during this hit. I was moving in what seemed to be some very strange ways. I have noticed that 5-MeO and mushrooms both have some very strange bodily manifesting energies. They both move through my body in similar ways, an almost wavelike motion that is not unlike throwing up. I also felt a fair degree of nausea on this second hit, but I don't think I was ever in serious danger of throwing up.

<P>The music of Necropolis suffused every fiber of my being, propelled me deep into the core of the universe, pulled me apart and rebuilt me around itself. It was a singularly beautiful and sublime experience. It heightened my appreciation for one of my favorite albums ever and the singular, visionary artist who created it.

<P>After that song I sat and listened to some more of the album, and again considered taking a longer lasting visionary agent. Except for the fact that it was 4:30 in the morning I would have done it. At that hour it didn't seem like such a great idea, considering I had things to do the next day. If I had, I suspect it would have been an awesomely good trip. The feeling of cosmic rightness and infinite beauty I was left with after that experience could only have propelled me into a truly singular trip.

<P>After some consideration I decided the only thing I was really up for at that late hour was another hit of    5-MeO. So I loaded up a large one and smoked it in two hits. I was propelled to the outer edges of being, rebounded from them and forced back into my body, only to explode outwards again and again, all in time to the Julian Cope song Subtle Energies Commission. Wow... This song provided another amazing, world shaking experience, perhaps not quite as beautifully sublime as the previous hit.  When you are talking about beauty of that degree, what is the difference really? This last hit lasted well into the next song (it was a rather big hit...) and the after glow left me vibrating through the end of the album.

<P>Afterwards I got on my computer and worked on some projects. I felt very good, creative and into what I was doing. After twenty five minutes or so of work I was ready to go to bed. I slept well and felt fine the next day.

<P>The next morning as I was taking notes on the trip I decided to take another hit on the pipe to see if there was any residue. There was enough to propel me slightly into a 5-MeO experience. I didn't go really deep, but I did get wet, so to speak. It brought a lot of the previous night's trip back to me. I have often thought that one can really only recall the details of a trip while on another trip. This would seem to bear this out to some degree. Before I smoked the hit my recall of the experience was fairly impressionistic, without fine detail. During and immediately after the hit I suddenly recalled in much finer detail the events and feelings of the trip. This is interesting and would seem to bear more research.

<P>All of these experiences had some common elements, most of which are also common to my previous experience with this agent. 5-MeO seems to act as an expectorant. Whenever I do it I usually have to spit out phlegm during or after the trip. I have noticed that many (most? All?) of the psychedelics have this effect to some degree or another. They all seem to change the consistency and amount of my phlegm. Each agent seems to have it's own characteristic effect in this regard. In other words, my shroom snot is qualitatively different than my 5-MeO or LSD snot. I had never given this much thought, but I was having sinus troubles anyway around this time, and the effect was more pronounced on several trips I took. 

<P>On each hit, as I came down, my mind seemed to be sifting through hundreds, if not thousands of pieces of data, memories and thoughts about various things, mostly current events and strongly emotional issues. On this occasion it was focused mainly on my thoughts and feelings about a girl I had recently started dating. These "reviews" seem like they might be a miniature version of the "life flash before your eyes" many people report in near death experiences. They have been interesting and at times therapeutic for me as well, on several occasions confirming or suggesting insights.

<P>Overall these experiences were quite wonderful. They provided more confirmation that 5-MeO can be positively influence and be influenced by listening to music. I will continue experiments in this vein as I have the time and inclination. As usual, 5-MeO seems to offer a glimpse into the eternal energy behind reality. I find this vision awe inspiring, a direct experience of the reality of the idea that we are all one being, one consciousness.
