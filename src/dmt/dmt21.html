<P>One night while waiting for my fianc�e to come home from work I decided to try smoking some 5-MeO-DMT.  I loaded up a generous amount into my pipe.  Slowly, I vaporized the material into a thick cloud of vapor and slowly inhaled it.  It was harsh and had an unpleasant, plastic taste.

<P>I barely had time to set the pipe down before being launched into a powerful experience.  I felt accelerated to the edge of reality.  At that imaginary point I exploded into a serene, egoless state.  

<P>I was conscious during the entire experience.  Yet upon returning I had little recall of the time (nearly ten minutes) I was under the influence.  I was left with a generous after buzz and vague recollection of an awesome experience at the edge of reality.  I also had a powerful sexual awareness and desire.  I suddenly wished that I waited until my lover arrived home before tripping�

<P>I lay in bed enjoying the leftover trippiness for a few minutes before getting up to take a shower.  As I got into the shower I noticed my pupils seemed dilated a bit.  I wasn't sober yet, I still felt altered and trippy. It was a nice, warm, peaceful feeling.  As usual I was left with a feeling that everything was right with the world.

<P><A NAME="pt2"></A>A few nights later I decided to try smoking a similar amount.  I did so and again was launched quickly into a swirling, explosive state of being.  I was aware of my mind racing through thoughts and perceptions as I melted into a state of unity with the universe.  

<P>Again, I think I was conscious during the trip.  I remember having the trip.  But, I could not then and can not now remember what it was I was experiencing.  I just knew it was awesome and incredibly intense.

<P>I noticed I was in a different position than I had started in.  I had apparently moved around quite a bit while under the influence.  I even noticed later that I had given myself some rug burn on the carpet somehow.  Close to ten minutes had passed between take off and recovery, but it felt like only one or two had passed.  

<P>Again the afterglow was terrific.  It had a warm, heart opening feel to it like mushrooms or MDMA, but with its own signature.  I wanted to be with my friends and share the experience. I went out into the living room and talked to M, my roommate.  I noticed the spider plant in our living room and was powerfully reminded of seeing a very similar plant on a mushroom trip years ago.  Again its aliveness and presence impressed me.  This time I felt much more accepting and glad of its presence.

<P>M and I smoked some pot and I drifted out of cosmic trippiness into a mellow stoned state.  I stayed up for a few more hours before heading to bed and a good nights sleep.

<P>Both of these trips were awesome, but it is frustrating that I can't recall the substance of either one.  I have only the vaguest recollection of either experience.  I was reminded again that when using strong psychedelics it is wise to either have a sitter or be in a situation where you can't inadvertently hurt yourself while moving about insensibly.  If I had knocked a candle over and let it burn for three or four minutes I could have been seriously injured or even killed.  I definitely avoid open flame unless there is someone in a state to watch over it or me, and there are other situations that could be just as dangerous.
