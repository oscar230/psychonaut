<P>Recently I acquired a new pipe for smoking 5-MeO-DMT and DMT.  Since I acquired it I have been toying with the idea of using my old 5-MeO pipe for marijuana, since it is a nice handblown glass pipe.  Finally I decided to go ahead and do it since the new pipe worked so much better than the old one anyway.  It occurred to me that there might be some residue left on the pipe from my early 5-MeO experiments so I decided to check before smoking anything else out of it.

<P>I got the pipe out and hit it like I would if there was something in it.  I held the heated air in my lungs, noting that there was a slight but definite DMT like taste present.  This taste is highly reminiscent of burnt plastic and seems similar for both N,N,-DMT (which I usually refer to as simply DMT) and 5-MeO-DMT.  Yummy.  Anyway, I held my breath and sure enough I was noticing a characteristic 5-MeO tone and rising electric feeling.  I exhaled and was almost immediately plowed deeply into a swirling 5-MeO trip.

<P>The room shimmered and broke up into shreds of light and folding space that tried to fold themselves into my head. My breathing provided a line to follow through the experience, as I swam through the electric noncorporeal side of existence back to my body, lying on my bed.  

<P>"Well," I thought, "that was interesting." Then it occurred to me that perhaps I hadn't gotten it all.  I repeated the process, heating the pipe up and inhaling.  Again I tasted burnt plastic and before too long I was rocketing through hyperspace, experiencing being as nothing more than one pattern in a breathing, living dimension of patterns just like me and yet completely different, one snowflake in a blizzard, each unique and yet essentially the same.  A very cosmic perception and one that leaves me at peace without fail.  

<P>As I returned I noticed that my hearing seemed particularly enhanced. Something moved in my closet, and my whole room seemed to be moving and shifting somehow.  Everything I looked at seemed alive.  I had a strong intuition that I should do something but I wasn't sure what.  A song was going through my head and it occurred to me that I had never really tried listening to music on a decent dose of 5-MeO.  I had heard music once on an early threshold level trip, but my experience of 5-MeO was entirely different now.  I decided to give it a try.

<P>I loaded up a hit and got everything ready.  I put on the new Soul Coughing album (El Oso) and cued up the fifth song, St. Louise is Listening, the song that was going through my head as I came back from my previous jaunt.  I smoked the hit of 5-MeO and hit play as I lay back.

<P>It was amazing. I don't even know what to say about this experience.  I love music, love listening to it on entheogens, love everything about it.  The 5-MeO seemed to wrap me around the beat while the words penetrated my soul.  Every sound seemed to be part of me, I seemed to be part of the song. Synaesthetic visuals pulsed in time with the beat, bold simple patterns etched in shimmering arcs of electricity.  The whole trip lasted just about as long as the song, conveniently enough.

<P>Well.  After that what else could I do but start the album from the beginning and go again?  I loaded up another hit and smoked it as I restarted the album.  Again "I" was taken away, leaving just the music pulsing and breathing in my place.  Throughout the album I loaded and smoked small hits until what I had easily at hand was gone.  At that point I smoked the residue that was left in the neck of the pipe when I needed a slight boost.  I did this roughly every other song throughout the album, maintaining a low level 5-MeO trip with occasional "spikes" of full on 5-MeO glory throughout. During one of these spikes I had a lot of bodily manifesting energy which moved me around on my bed quite a bit.  When I "came back" from that hit I was turned around 180 degrees from where I started. 

<P>The whole album was enjoyable in this state, but nothing lived up to the first listen with MeO.  Overall I think it was a worthwhile experiment, worth repeating again at some point in the future.  It gave me a new perspective on 5-MeO, an amazing substance that is rapidly becoming a favorite of mine.
