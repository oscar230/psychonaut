<P>After my last trip I had decided to take some time off from 
psychedelics to try and integrate some of my insights and evaluate the 
things I had become aware of through my recent experiences. After a 
month I decided it was time to visit the imaginal realms again. After 
some consideration I chose to journey with 5-MeO-DMT.

<P>My intentions for the trip were to explore the ineffable 5-MeO 
experience to a greater degree. My previous experiences with it had all been 
good and I felt that there was much more to be learned. In particular 
there were a couple of aspects I had become aware of on previous trips 
that I wished to explore further. One was stress relief. Work had 
been stressing me out to a fairly high degree the past few weeks and I 
hoped to experience the extremely peaceful "afterglow" that 5-MeO 
often leaves me with. Another thing was the sexual aspect of 5-MeO. 
On several earlier trips I had felt a heightened sexual awareness and 
a sense of being sexually charged up after coming back from a 5-MeO 
shot. I should specify that the 5-MeO experience itself doesn't seem 
to be sexual, since it always seems far too out of body to have any 
sexual aspects. It is the "afterglow" that usually leaves me, for 
lack of a better word, horny. Lastly, I hoped to gain some insight 
into a situation in my life that was perplexing me to some degree.

<P>I loaded up a bit of 5-Me0 on top of some ash and slowly heated and 
vaporized the small amount of white crystal while inhaling the vapors. 
I had time to set the pipe down and think (as I so often do�) "This 
isn't going to be as intense as my last experience�" before being 
thrust seemingly into a full being experience of the full on objective 
nature of the raw, unfiltered universe.

<P>The experience is completely ecstatic (i.e. out of body). It is a 
sensation of being part of the folding, non-Euclidean geometry of the 
universe. A realization of being on a quantum level. I have read 
theories that the 5-MeO and DMT experiences are some sort of 
pre-death/near death experience, and it is easy to see how one could 
come to that conclusion. It is a very completely egoless state. I 
think that the stress relieving aspect of it comes from the 
realization, however brief, of the smallness and pettiness of ones 
worldly concerns in the face of the seemingly certain knowledge of 
something bigger, the feeling that "this too shall pass", a glimpse of 
the eternal behind everything.

<P>As I came back I went into another room for some privacy to 
masturbate. I didn't feel the sexual charge to the same degree as I 
had on previous trips, but I had already decided to try an experiment 
and was determined to carry it out. It was less than spectacular and 
had a sort of desperate quality to it. The only positive thing about 
it was that I had a flash of insight into my sexuality, a realization 
that much of my sex life has been an acting out of a repressed trauma 
from my childhood that had recently come to light during an LSD trip.

<P>After that I still felt the aftershock of the 5-MeO as a sort of 
energy tremor coursing throughout my body, a not unpleasant sensation. 
My stress from work was indeed reduced considerably, but I wasn't as at 
peace as I have been in past experiences, probably because of the 
somewhat strange quality of my sexual experiment. Even so, I felt 
quite good afterwards and was happy with the results of the trip. 
Although I hadn't gotten much insight into the question I had in my 
mind going in other than a sort of generic feeling to tread lightly, I 
had gotten more insight into something else potentially more valuable. 
Overall it was an excellent trip and a great reintroduction to 
entheogens after my month long fast.
