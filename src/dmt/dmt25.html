<P>I was alone at home.  5-MeO-DMT called me and I responded.  I smoked the hit in my living room.  I chose not to accompany the trip with music.

<P>The MeO took off with my consciousness.  The sounds of my house began coalescing and congealing into something.  Out of chaos came an enigmatic and compelling rhythm.  The hum of the refrigerator split itself into pieces and out emerged strange melody and accompaniment.  Out of nowhere a beat appeared, cementing it all together and propelling it into my deepest awareness.  I was hearing the coolest, most intense and excellent electronic dance music I have ever heard, all created by the interaction of 5-MeO-DMT, the noises in my living room and my brain.

<P>I have never heard anything like it.  The closest I have come is the strange abstract "music" I often get on mushrooms.  This was more realized, more compelling and overall, incredible.  If I could record the sounds that I heard as I tripped through that experience I would be one of the world's most celebrated and respected dance music producers!  It was that cool.

<P>After I returned I had to smoke again.  I got the same strange, compelling music.  I just sat and listened as it obliterated my ego and took me through itself and out the other side where I returned to my body as the music faded slowly back into its component sounds. Beautiful and perfect.
