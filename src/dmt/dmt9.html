<P>Two weeks after my previous 5-MeO experience I decided to try it again.  All day I had been dealing with an unpleasant situation in my personal life and it had me quite perplexed and in a somewhat down mood.  I was planning on tripping mushrooms the next day and I didn't really want to go into that space with the negative energy I was carrying if I could avoid it.  Although none of my previous 5-MeO trips had proved particularly insightful on a personal level, I thought it might help me sort out my feelings and figure out what I should do.  If nothing else, I hoped it might alleviate some of the tension that had been built up and help me to relax.

<P>As I loaded the 5-MeO in my pipe I was focusing on the day's events and asking for insight and suggestions for a resolution.  I vaporized and inhaled the material in one hit, holding it deep within my lungs.  As it started coming on I feared I hadn't gotten enough, since I was retaining awareness of the room.  I was mistaken.

<P>Although I retained consciousness of my self, my thoughts expanded rapidly, running through memories and examining various aspects of my question with surety and speed.  Hundreds of pieces of data were processed and considered and as I sat there, vibrating in tune with the universe.  It felt like all angles of my quandary were explored and processed, leading inevitably to a solid conclusion.  As I came down, some five or six minutes after takeoff, I had the answer to my question.  Suddenly, the issue that had seemed hopelessly complicated was made simple.  I also felt a tremendous release from the tension I had been feeling.  All in all, I felt quite wonderful.

<P>I decided that since my first trip had been so productive, and had freed me from the rather ego centered state of being I was in, that I would try another hit in an attempt to penetrate deeper into the experience.  I loaded and smoked another hit of roughly the same size as the first and lay back as it came on.

<P>This time, I felt as if I were being penetrated by energetic consciousness, spirits of some sort.  They felt very distinctly Other, not me.  This was a very interesting phenomenon, very similar to my last 5-MeO experience.  Again, I felt compelled to move my body about in various ways, as if I was being manipulated to express these energies.  The state of mind felt very tuned in to a racial consciousness, or collective unconscious.  I had the feeling that these were some sort of ancestor spirits.

<P>Coming back from this I was amazed.  Both jaunts had been entirely positive and fascinating in totally different ways.  I decided that I would try a third and final experiment to see if I could penetrate deeper yet.  Again I loaded a small amount, close to what I loaded on the previous trips, and smoked it in one hit, lying back as it came on.

<P>Within seconds I was propelled to a deep, alien level of being.  It was a strange, geometric level of consciousness.  It felt very pristine, very true, like a dip into the well of the godhead.  I felt completely suffused by this alien presence.  On my previous trip, I felt like I was sharing consciousness with some Other.  This felt like all the boundaries had been removed, and I stood revealed as a tiny part of what I might call Other, but was in fact One.

<P>This last trip felt completely alien and yet completely familiar.  It was completely unlike what you could ever call human, yet it felt like a familiar and recognized state of being.  It was a new lesson in infinity, cosmic, transcendent and alien.  

<P>After coming down I lay in bed for a while thinking about the experience and its implications.  I was in a very positive state of mind.  My first trip had been very personal, centered on my self and my day to day troubles.  The second was racial, dipping into the collective unconscious and revealing something of our true nature to me.  The last was completely transcendent, moving me out beyond any level I have previously experienced, into a unique and alien viewpoint. I slept well and had a fine day afterwards.
