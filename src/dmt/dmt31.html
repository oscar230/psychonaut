<P>One night, before bed I decided to do a quick 5-MeO-DMT experiment. I had been meaning to time my 5-MeO-DMT trips for a while, because I was never quite sure how long I was out. This time I grabbed a stopwatch and prepared to do some actual documentation.

<P>I loaded up a good sized hit and smoke it quickly. It came on strong, obliterating all of the familiar references to the physical world. I remember feeling overwhelmed, a sensation of brilliant white light and a seemingly timeless space. The return journey as my body reassimilated itself seemed to take place in slow motion. It was like everything was half speed. As I became more and more aware I remember I had set a stopwatch to time myself and reached down to look at it. Although I though surely I had been out nearly ten minutes, if not more, I was actually only gone for a little less than five minutes. I was amazed!

<P>I decided to try again to see if it would last longer, or at least seem to. I loaded up a similar sized hit to the first one and smoked it. It was of similar intensity, propelling me into an egoless space where I lost track of all familiar physical references, my ego and the notion of time itself. My return was again slow, leisurely, taking all the time in the world. This one, I thought, as I reformed more completely, had to have lasted at least seven or eight minutesï¿½but when I looked only four and a half minutes had pass.   

<P>As amazing as it seems, apparently one can experience eternity in only five minutes.
