Friday, February 20 I performed another experiment with 5-MeO-DMT.  After arriving home from work
I did my usual half hour meditation.  Afterwards I got the glass pipe I purchased for this purpose and
prepared to ingest the sacrament.  I prepared the material the same way I described in my <A HREF="dmt2.htm.html">first
MeO report.</A>

<P>I held the lighter about half an inch above the 5-MeO and slowly toked in, drawing the heat down to
melt and vaporize the crystals.There was little or no taste.  I held the vapor for some time (15-25
seconds?) and was feeling the first effects before I exhaled.

<P>There was a sense of tremendous energy pouring into or out of me (or both).  I felt I was the conduit
for a great deal of energy.  Things seemed "wobbly", on the verge of being distorted, but not quite
there.  I burned the oregano to get any material that might be left and lie back with its taste in my
mouth.

<P>Again the whole experience seemed centered around my breathing.  I felt I was vibrating, or
resonating with an external vibration.  My vision seemed to want to curl up or fold like some sort of
Escher drawing, but it never manifested to any significant degree.  For a moment I thought of some
song lyrics, then remembered not to think and closed my eyes.

<P>With eyes closed there were no particular visuals, though it seemed a light of some sort wanted to
creep in.  Maybe at a higher dosage...When I opened my eyes, the ceiling was definitely crawling, a
common psychedelic visual effect.  It was not as active or colorful as with some other psychedelics,
but it was definitely there.

<P>As I lay there breathing, being, and enjoying the sensation, a familiar knock came at my door.  I
called out "Come in" and in came A, a good friend of mine.  After a few seconds he asked if I had
smoked some 5-MeO and I told him I had indeed.  He asked how it was going and I told him it was
manageable.  He sat quietly as I lay back and breathed and enjoyed the mild remainder of the trip.
The whole thing lasted something like 10-12 minutes.

<P>Afterwards he and I sat and chatted.  I sat and thought about my trip.  I had intended to go higher
than my last time and had ended up about the same place.  I was being especially careful, since I
didn't want to overwhelm myself, but I had ended up being too conservative.  After thinking about it a
few minutes I decided to try again

<P>I loaded up what I hoped was a slightly higher dosage.  I smoked it in the same manner.  Again I
began to feel a deep vibration moving through me.  There was also a general "trippy" feeling that is
difficult to describe, but I'm sure would be recognized by most anyone who has ever explored
psychedelics.  I found myself focusing on breathing , like before.  This material seems to do strange
things to one's breathing, or at least to the perception of it.

<P>As I said, I had been hoping to go a little deeper.  Instead, I got slightly less.  This may have been
tolerance (unlikely, it's not supposed to produce much tolerance) but was more likely just me being
too cautious again.  It's hard to find a middle ground with such a potent material.

<P>I continued to feel a sort of vibration after all the other effects had subsided (again, 10-12 min) which
manifested itself as shaking.  This wasn't unpleasant, and it didn't last too long.

<P>So, I was aiming for a medium level experience and ended up with two just over threshold trips.  I
would call them +1.5-+2 on the Shulgin scale.  A definite effect, not really ignorable, but not all the
way there either. Both excursions were similar to each other and to my first experience.  Even at
this low level, I can feel it's power and I suspect it would be too intense for some.
