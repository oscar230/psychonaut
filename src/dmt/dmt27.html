<P>DMT is strange stuff.  It has a strong, alien smell.  It smells like mothballs. Somehow you feel like you can tell you are looking at something mind warping.  It seems to have a presence of its own.  Placed in a glass bubble pipe and heated it creates a thick white vapor with a taste as strange and foreboding as the appearance and smell. At that point there is no longer just a vague sense that you are in the presence of something powerful.  Before you exhale the first hit you are already being propelled into something awesomely intense, overwhelming.

<P>I set down the pipe with my last vestige of control.  A moment of near panic; "I think I must have gotten too much!" flashes through my head as reality implodes into the space behind my eyes.  The room twists and vibrates so much I have no choice but to close my eyes.  I feel like I am shaking along with everything else that makes up my reality.

<P>I see faces around me, looking at me.  Fantastically strange until I realize that most if not all of the faces staring at me are my own at which point it becomes even stranger!  I have to laugh at loud at the absurdity of it.  I open my eyes for a second, but the picture isn't much different.  Faces swarm around me and every time I bring one into focus it turns out to be myself.

<P>My eyes alternate between open and closed as I begin asking myself what I am experiencing.  Some part of me knows I am on a drug, name unimportant, but what I really want to know is "What the hell?!?"  Theories present themselves rapidly.  Maybe I am experiencing multiple parallel realities simultaneously.  Perhaps time has folded itself until I see it overlapping past and future into one.  Fleeting ideas that only leaves me more amazed.  More laughter bubbles out of me.

<P>I am returning now.  I still feel the DMT strongly, but reality is coalescing into its familiar shape.  I can recall almost all of the experience, I am still up, glowing fiercely and stunned by the elegant chaotic beauty of it.  I feel cleansed and happy, a ball of explosive joy.  

<P>The next twenty minutes are blissful but much of the detail seeps away quickly.  I am left with the highlights, vivid memories of an incredible, strange and beautiful peek into another form of reality.  I smoke most of the residue left in the pipe, which helps me maintain my elevated state but fails to propel me into anything visionary again.  

<P>My thoughts later go to the inevitable comparisons.  It has characteristics in common with 5-MeO-DMT and Salvia and high mushroom doses.  They are similar but not the same.  The DMT is strange yet intimate, like a very dear old friend you haven't seen in many years…
