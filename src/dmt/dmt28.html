<P>Recently my grandmother died, necessitating a journey out of state to attend the funeral.  When I returned I read that Terence McKenna had died in the time I was away.  This put me in a reflective, almost morose mood.  I decided to smoke some 5-MeO-DMT to say goodbye to these people that had impacted my life in such profound (though very different) ways.

I prepared and smoked a decent sized hit in my basement trip room.  I was wrapped in the now familiar embrace of 5-MeO-DMT as the world accelerated to the edge of reality and imploded once it got there.  The radiance of union with all perceived reality lasted a few wonderful minutes, leaving me feeling better but not quite good.

I smoked several more hits over the next fifteen or twenty minutes, until I had exhausted my readily available supply of material.  I was left feeling very psychedelicized but still not quite "there" yet.  Rarely one to leave well enough alone I thought about going upstairs to get a little more from my dwindling stash.  As I was considering this I noticed that there was a big chunk of residue in my DMT pipe.  A little light went on and I knew what I had to do.

I heated and inhaled the thick vapors of DMT.  My perceptions began to swirl into a crazy corkscrew of color and shape as everything tried to occupy my full attention simultaneously.  I enjoyed the show for a disappointingly short period of time before I was returned to semi normal consciousness.  I did notice that I hadn't gotten much of the material and decided to try again.

The second hit was equally intense if considerably less visual.  In a way very reminiscent of 5-MeO-DMT my thoughts and emotions began racing as the drug took hold.  I considered my grandmother, my love for her, how far we had drifted apart in the last few years before she died.  I thought of Terence McKenna, gone from the world but surely just as amusing and creative and vital wherever he was now.  I thought of how stressful and full of angst my existence had been in the previous few months, of a long painful discussion with my sister in law a few days before, of how confused and painful my existence was at this point in my life.  Everything built and built and suddenly, there was release. I began to cry there on the floor, deep sobs as tears streamed down my face.  I lay there, crying for several minutes as the world returned.  And when I was done I felt great.  Better than I had in months, maybe as good as I ever have.  I felt cleansed.  I was sure that if I could just maintain and work my way through, everything would be OK again, the world would make sense again and the terrible strain I had been under would disappear.  

Afterwards, I slept very well.  I am very thankful for this trip.  I knew I was stressed out when I took it, but I don't think I had any idea of the degree of pressure I was under.  During this period I have been reluctant to take many psychedelics for fear of not being able to handle the effects, but this was definitely a necessary thing to do.  DMT is some truly amazing stuff!
