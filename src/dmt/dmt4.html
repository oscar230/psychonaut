<BODY BGCOLOR="BLACK" TEXT="WHITE" LINK="DODGERBLUE" VLINK="DARKORCHID"><P>On the one month anniversary of my first 5-MeO trip I decided to perform another experiment with it.
So, Friday, March 13th I loaded up a small amount of this white, crystalline substance into my DMT
pipe on top of some oregano and a small amount of ash. I attempted to melt and vaporize the
material a bit before letting the oregano burn and inhaling all the vapor. As I held my breath the
effects began moving in, a feeling like a rising hum, subaudible but detected somehow. The effects
were coming on fairly slowly, which led me to believe I had underestimated my dose, even though I
had used nearly twice what I had previously (as far as I could tell eyeballing it).

<P>I had succeeded in going farther though. The effects, though very similar to what I have had before,
were more intense. A few times over the course of the ten or twelve minute ride I had the feeling of
"Well, this could stop now and I wouldn't really mind". It hovered on the edge of being
overwhelming, but I was able to focus on my breathing and ease my way through it.

<P>With my eyes open, sitting up, I began sensing a lot of motion around me. Everything was
"crawling" but there was little or no patterning effect. When I closed my eyes I sensed/felt/saw (a
definite synesthesia thing) then universe/space folding around and through me. In addition to this
rapidly folding geometry there was a fair amount of light. I felt like my consciousness/being was part
of this pattern moving through time and space. It was a very positive, comfortable feeling. It
engendered a sense of being one with the universe.

<P>The calm state this left me in was quite wonderful. I had once again achieved with 5-MeO what I
attempt with meditation, a profound and easy sense of BEing, my thoughts still and my mind quiet.
It left me more relaxed than I had been in weeks.

<P>My trips with 5-MeO have definitely had some consistent elements. There is a definite sense of
energy flow and vibration. It is a very strange trip. Even at these low levels, it is fairly intense. But,
it is hard to put a finger on. There is no question you are tripping, but there aren't many definable
effects. It's like everything just gets suddenly a great deal more intense.

<P>I felt a compulsion to move my body, even to twitch. It seemed as if the energies were trying to
align my physical being to serve as a better conduit for their transmission. I moved my hands in
front of my face in elaborate patterns and enjoyed the trails that were left in the air behind them.

<P>Towards the end of the trip the energy started to take on a sexual edge. I was aware of a huge
charge of sexual energy present in my being. I felt this very strong male energy coming from me
and thought about some of the women I have previously been involved with and other women I know
that I haven't been involved with. I thought it might be time to start seeking female companionship.

<P>After coming down I lie on the floor, totally relaxed, at ease, at peace. Everything seemed right with
the world and myself. All my stress from work and other events in life had evaporated and left me
centered and calm. I think my daily meditation helped me to flow through the experience and get
as much out of it as possible. I had the thought that it might be useful to smoke this stuff once a
week to discharge all the tension from the week that had built up. The experience was very
therapeutic.

<P>I was trying for more of a hyperspace, out of body experience. Although I missed my mark, I did
feel the experience was very positive and worthwhile, so I wasn't really disappointed. I will continue
to slowly up the dose until I get to the level I have heard is possible, the out of body, out of space,
cosmic unity experience. I am also thinking about smoking some while already tripping on LSD or
mushrooms, as I think that could be a very interesting and positive synergy
