<P>I decided to smoke a little 5-MeO-DMT one evening.  I loaded it up, smoke it and had a nice, typical mid level trip off it that left me altered and glowing but unsatisfied.  Since I had recently acquired a small sample of DMT I decided to go ahead and try a small taste to see what it was like.

<P>I loaded the tiniest bit into my pipe and smoked it.  It tasted rank, much worse than 5-MeO-DMT.  I braced my self for possible chaos, but got very little, just a strong sensation of pressure around my temples (which I have noticed on several tryptamines, especially threshold doses of 5-MeO-DMT and the onset of mushrooms trips) and a sort of weird visual effect.  My perspective became oddly distorted.  Things seemed to grow and shrink, becoming elongated or stretched.  This lasted for only a few minutes before it dissipated.  Since I wasn't up for any hardcore journeying I decided to put away the material and save the real trips for another time.
