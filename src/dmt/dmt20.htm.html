<P>The morning after my previous 5-MeO-DMT trip my fiancée woke me up as she returned from work.  As I told her about it she expressed some curiosity about it and what it was like.  I told her what I could express easily in words and a little about its history and chemical nature.  She expressed some desire to do it and I encouraged her to do so if she thought it sounded interesting.  

<P>She debated with herself and asked me a few more questions before finally deciding to give it a try.  I loaded up a small amount and instructed her how to smoke it.  She took a smallish hit and immediately coughed it out.  At my urging she took another small hit and laid back to await effects.  I watched her for a few minutes, trying to judge her level of inebriation.  She seemed to be feeling it, but it was hard to say how strongly.  I noticed there was still a significant amount of what I had loaded left, so I vaporized and inhaled it myself.

<P>The amount I got was just enough to give me the edge of the trip, but it did make me suddenly very sexually aware. I leaned over and kissed L's stomach and began running my fingers over her skin. She responded at first then asked me to stop.  She sat up and said she didn't think she had gotten enough.  I agreed and asked if she wanted to smoke more.  She said she wanted to think about it a bit.

<P>She and I sat back in bed talking about it while she made up her mind.  Finally, ten or fifteen minutes after her first attempt she decided to try it again.

<P>I loaded up a larger amount than her first try and told her to try and get as much of it as possible.  She hit the pipe, getting only a small amount of the white vapor.  I told her to try again and she did twice more.  Finally, after her third small hit she lay back and went into the MeOverse.

<P>I watched as her eyes moved behind closed eyelids and her breathing became deep and a bit ragged.  She didn't move much until close to the end when she reached out for my hand.  As she returned she had an awestruck look on her face. I smiled down at her, waiting for her to speak.  When she was able she expressed amazement at the experience.  She said she had liked it a lot and wanted to do it again sometime in the future.

<P>I asked if she minded if I did a hit at that point.  She said she wouldn't mind at all, so I prepared a good sized hit for myself.  

<P>I had read in The Essential Psychedelic Guide that 5-MeO-DMT could be intensely visual if used at the moment of orgasm, and my own experience indicated it had an intensely sexual edge to it at certain times.  In light of this I proposed an experiment to L.  I asked if she would mind much stimulating me orally while I smoked my hit.  She lit up with a mischievious smile and said it sounded like fun.

<P>As she started her ministrations I held the flame under the pipe and slowly inhaled the thick white vapor with the delightful plastic taste, setting the pipe down as I finished what appeared to be the last of the material present in the pipe.

<P>I leaned back against the wall as the effects manifested. Unlike my previous hits I didn't go completely out of body and reality.  Instead, my entire awareness became focused on the sensations in my groin.  I gasped as it was incredibly intense, one of the most intense sensations I have been privileged to experience.  L asked if I wished her to stop and I managed to mutter "Definitely not".  My visual field was full of intricate trails of black and white geometric designs that emanated from the point of contact between myself and L.  It was unlike anything I have ever experienced.

<P>I asked L to kiss me and she moved up to comply.  I was incredibly turned on, suffused with a huge sexual charge.  We began kissing, caressing and exploring each other.  Our explorations led to intense, urgent sex.  I think we were both feeling the erotic charge of the 5-MeO-DMT after effects.

<P>Our sex lasted for a good long while and ended in a mutually explosive orgasm.  During the sex I felt incredibly good, clean and close to my lover.  I felt like we were inside each other's consciousness, driving one another to new heights of intensity as we fed back our pleasure into each other.  It was real, real neat.

<P>Afterwards we lay together, kissing and talking and cuddling in a beautiful sex and MeO afterglow.  Before long we both slipped off to sleep and beautiful dreams.

<P>Later that night, I decided to try smoking some more on my own.  I loaded up a very small amount and inhaled it.  It lifted me up, but didn't really go anywhere.  I repeated this several times, each time reaching a pleasantly altered space that refused to go any further.  After several attempts with increasingly larger amounts I finally decided to call it a night, and went to bed.

<P>This experiment definitely confirmed my theory that 5-MeO-DMT has erotic potential.  The only substance that has produced similarly impressive results has been its close cousin 5-MeO-DIPT.  I quite enjoyed not only the physical aspects of the experience, but also the sense of closeness and consciousness sharing that it helped to create.  I definitely intend to pursue this avenue in the future.
