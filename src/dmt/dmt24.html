<P>Some 5-MeO-DMT was smoked, accompanied by the sounds of LSG's Black Album.  The music took over my reality, jacking me into a matrix of beats and sound, twisting me around itself as it twisted itself around me.  I smoked it a couple of times, each time lasting roughly the length of one song.  

<P>I penetrated deeply into the music as it took me on a magical mystery ride through the outskirts of reality.  As usual the music dominated the experience.  I felt superb as I came off the trip but my warm and fuzzy afterglow was interrupted by a call from L, my ex girlfriend.  For whatever reason we ended up having a huge fight over the phone and my mood was tattered and shredded, leaving me with only a vague sensation of having been altered earlier, and none of the peaceful meditative state I am usually blessed with for several hours afterwards.  

<P><A NAME="p2"></A>Several nights later, after returning home from a disastrous night out I decided a hit of 5-MeO-DMT might help me put my head straight. My car had broken down many miles from home, I'd spent a fair amount of my time out obsessing about what L was doing and various other annoyances had all conspired to stress me out to an unmanageable level.  I figured visiting the ground of being for a few minutes might put it all in perspective. 

<P>I smoked a medium to smallish hit and sat back to ride it out.  It failed to completely obliterate awareness of the room but was still powerful.  I felt a buzzing vibration that seemed to move through my consciousness and body, cleansing and smoothing things as it moved through me.  It had a definite visual element as I "saw" in my mind's eye the whole experience taking place, me sitting on my living room floor, the energy racing through me.  My thoughts were accelerated, I realized that a car is a car and not worth worrying about, a girl a girl and also not worth the bother I was going to and that everything would work itself out if I could just maintain focus and see it through. 

<P>When I popped back to waking consciousness I was greatly relieved and mellowed out.  I smoked a small amount of high grade cannabis and relaxed with some music.  The rest of my night until bedtime was pretty mellow and I was glad I smoked the 5-MeO-DMT.  It had definitely helped me place things in perspective and relax. 

<P><A NAME="p3"></A>Some time after that I smoked again.  This time the sounds of Sasha's Ibiza mix album shattered my consciousness into crystalline shards that were pushed on an ecstatic wind.  The music became my reality, I heard it ever so clearly, nothing interfered or intruded, I was alone with the music.  More than that, I alone WAS the music, the music was me and everything else ceased to exist for a timeless eternity that turned out to be less than three minutes long.  I smoked several times (three or four total) as the album played, each time experiencing a beautiful, soulful window of clarity.  The music spoke to me and moved me and reverberated in the ecstatic headspace I entered with the aid of the 5-MeO-DMT.  It was superb, and left me feeling very, very happy.

<P>These trips have reconfirmed what I already believed about 5-MeO-DMT.  It is a superb substance for putting things into perspective and realizing what is really important.  It allows one to penetrate deeply into music and appreciate subtle nuances of that music.  More than that, when used with music the music itself becomes the defining aspect of your reality, to the exclusion of all other stimuli.  5-MeO-DMT with music is a different experience than 5-MeO-DMT without music. Neither is necessarily better, they are just very different.
