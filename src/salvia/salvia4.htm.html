<P>In February I tried salvia again.  Prior to smoking the salvia I 
smoked some low grade commercial cannabis, getting stoned but not 
extremely so.   I loaded some crushed leaf into the extra large "salvia
 bowl" of my bong. After a minute to calm and center myself I smoked 
two big hits, which I held as long as I was able.  My mindset was one 
of expectant attention.

<P>Suddenly I seemed to be somewhere else.  Actually, while I was there, 
it didn't feel so much like "somewhere else".  It felt real.  My 
roommate seemed to be someone else. It was as if upon smoking the 
salvia my reality map had been switched without warning to something 
entirely different.  My attitudes, thoughts, feelings, etc towards 
everything seemed to change. I imagine being possessed might feel 
something like that.

<P>I started to come back fairly quickly, and realized who and where I 
was.  I also noticed that I had some more salvia in the bong, so I 
smoked this in another two large hits, again holding them for some 
time.  This catapulted me even deeper back into salvia space.

<P>Almost immediately after finishing the hit the phone rang.  My 
roommate answered it and took care of it, but it still impinged on my 
trip.  At this point I seemed to be a watery membrane, perhaps a few 
inches thick, that stretched through my apartment to where my roommate 
was talking on the phone, down through the neighbors apartment.  The 
phone call seemed to be imbedded in my substance in some strange way. 
This membrane seemed to contain everything my senses touched upon.  

<P>I felt like I couldn't or shouldn't open my eyes. Somehow I knew 
this would alter my reality considerably. This knowledge seemed to 
manifest as a perception of a domed surface, sort of like a piecrust 
from the inside and a desire not to split open the dome by opening my 
eyes.

<P>I lay on the floor with eyes closed, immersed in the salvia reality 
for some minutes.  As I started to come back I had a very distinct 
sense of losing my salvia reality.  It was if for every piece of 
knowledge or perception of this world that I recovered, a corresponding 
piece of salvia reality was lost. This was a very distinct perception 
and seems to confirm my theory that I bring back only a small piece of 
the salvia experience.

<P>While I was writing notes on the experience I had a flash of insight
 into what I have called "the Contest".  Generally as I go into a 
salvia experience I am in a slightly tense state of expectant 
awareness.  I believe that what I perceive as "the Contest" is my own 
expectations as I am disassociated from them.  I sense my own 
expectations and curiosity about whether or not I will "break through" 
and assign them to something outside myself.  In other words, it is my 
own intense attention that I am feeling, from "outside".  A very 
interesting effect.

<P>I found the cannabis helped me ease into the experience 
considerably.  Usually I am so astounded and confused going in, I 
immediately start fighting my way back to reality.  This time, I was 
able to relax into the experience and flow with it a little easier.  I 
have noticed similar effects while smoking salvia during a trip.  

<P>Each time I do salvia I find it interesting and thought provoking.  
Usually I am fairly eager to journey again.  Yet, I find it tends to be 
a fair amount of time between my salvia excursions. This time was no 
exception.  Soon after returning I was thinking about my next attempt, 
yet I have still not repeated the experience as I write this, some four 
months later.  I am not entirely sure why this is.  I suspect the very 
challenging nature of the experience is a large part of it.  Also, it 
is very perplexing, and each journey often leaves me more confused 
than the last.  Nevertheless, I do intend to continue experimentation 
with this plant, however infrequently it might occur.
