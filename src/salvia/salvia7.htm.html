<P>During an evening meditation session it occurred to me that I should try Salvia again.  For one thing, it had been awhile.  For another, I had recently made a new extract and hadn't tried it out yet.  Since the urge to smoke Salvia doesn't strike me often, I decided this would be an excellent opportunity.

<P>The extract was prepared according to directions I had found on Erowid's site.  It was an 8X extract, several times more potent than the roughly 6X extract I had made and tried before.  I went to load the bong and found it still had some marijuana left in it.  I didn't want to disturb it, since I hadn't left it there, and decided to smoke the extract out of a small glass pipe instead.  I loaded a very small amount of the extract into the pipe and prepared to smoke it.

<P>I cleared an area in my room and shut out all the lights.  I was alone in the house.  I took a few deep breaths to ready myself before raising the pipe to my mouth.  I held the lighter to the material in the pipe, lighting it as I drew on it.  I was rewarded with a mouthful of hot smoke, much hotter than I expected.  I nearly coughed it out, and succeeded in inhaling less than half the amount I put into the bowl.  I set the pipe down and lay down holding the smoke.  After thirty seconds or so I exhaled.  I felt only threshold effects, a slight feeling of being pulled down and a hint of disorientation.  Nothing else.  I picked up the pipe and hit it again, though most of what was in it had already burnt away.  The second hit didn't intensify the effects, though it may have extended their action.

<P>Not to be daunted I decided to smoke some 5-MeO-DMT to see if it was potentiated in any way.  I got my MeO pipe out and began heating the bottom of it.  After a few seconds of heating I pulled some air through the pipe and got a small hit of white vapor.  By the time I exhaled things were beginning to shimmer and I felt the familiar 5-MeO-DMT energy current.  Things didn't intensify much past that level, so I repeated the process, getting another, smaller hit of vapor that only kept things going at their present level a bit longer.

<P>I was ready to give up when I had the urge to try smoking a small Salvia leaf in the pipe.  I grabbed one from my stash and crumbled it into the pipe.  I smoked it in several small hits.  As I was smoking it I didn't think I was feeling much from it, but my thoughts began turning to previous Salvia trips.  One trip in particular occupied my thoughts, a trip where I'd had the sudden conviction that my soul or consciousness (as well as that of my daughter) was contained inside my Salvia plant, and that if anything happened to the plant, I would be in danger.  My thoughts spiraled around this idea, coming to the conclusion that this implied that the plant contained reality instead of reality containing the plant.  I suddenly had the thought that the plant must be Goddess.  This was followed by the thought that if the plant was Goddess, surely she could arrange for a sign to prove this to me...

<P>At that moment my front door opened, causing my bedroom door to pull itself toward the frame a bit.  I knew it was my roommate returning home but at the same time I felt it was an unmistakable sign.  I was astounded at this occurrence and its implications.  After a few seconds of sheer astonishment I began to realize just how high I really was off of the Salvia and decided I should check and see if there was really anyone home or not.  I walked into the living room, where a friend of M's was sitting.  We said hello and I walked into the kitchen to find my roommate.  He saw that I was zoomed and asked me how it was going.  I responded, somewhat distractedly that I was fine and turned and walked back to my room.

<P>In my room I lay down on the floor and considered what had just happened. I felt very much still under the influence of the Salvia.  Everything seemed odd, like I was experiencing a different frequency of reality.  I was struck with the urge to do a longer acting psychedelic agent to explore the implications, and as I considered it I was sure it would be an intense and powerful trip.  The presence of others in the house convinced me not to do it, however.  I mulled over the implications of what had just happened, and while I became less convinced that Salvia actually was Goddess, I definitely felt she was a guiding spirit, and one I should pay more attention to.  I felt like I had come in contact, momentarily, with one of the architects behind reality. I still felt stunned by the extreme weirdness of the trip and I was still feeling the effects of the drug.  These effects continued for another ten minutes, fading slowly.  

<P>I don't know what to say about this experience.  As I came down, the skeptic in me regained control and my conviction of Salvia's deityhood faded a bit (although I still remain very open to the possibility of it.  The experience reminded me of some of John Lilly's experiences with what he termed ECCO (Earth Coincidence Control Office) and also a bit of the book Valis, by Philip K. Dick (it also occurred to me that if you rearrange the word Salvia you get A Valis or ValisA...).  I certainly don't know what to make of the whole thing, but it has definitely stuck in my mind as one of my weirder experiences.
