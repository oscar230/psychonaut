Erowid Archives: Psychonaut: Four More Salvia Experiments - Salvia</title><meta NAME="description" CONTENT="Four Salvia Experiments"></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="Black" TEXT="White" LINK="DODGERBLUE" VLINK="darkorchid"><P>This report covers my next series of four experiments with smoked Salvia Divinorum.  The first two
of these were done utilizing leaf from Kava Kauai, the second two used leaf from Hoti.  I found the
Kava Kauai leaf to be more potent, but not by much.  Both are capable of launching an intrepid
traveler into the realms of the strange with great ease.

<P><A NAME="salv1"></A>After some thought I decided to try salvia while high on cannabis.  I had heard from a few people
this was an effective way of potentiating the experience and was curious to see for myself.  I started
with a few hits of high grade cannabis.  I got fairly high off of that.  Afterwards I loaded up some
salvia into the oversized bowl I utilize for this ally.  I took a total of four hits.  I started to feel it after
the second hit.  As I went to take the fourth hit I remember thinking "This will be my last hit".  Then
reality disappeared...

<P>It swarms in.  I am pushed aside as my reality shreds.  I am suddenly aware of something.
What is it?  A feeling like I have been here before.  Unstuck in time and space.  Maybe I have
exploded out of my body?  I feel like I am existing all over.  My consciousness has shattered.  I am
vibrating and thrumming and surfing atop a waveform of potentiality.  I feel some concern.  Will I get
back to reality?  The <I>right </I>reality?  My vision is vibrating.  My head is vibrating.

<P>I look at M, my roommate.  He looks strange.  I am not fully sure who he is.  Or who I am.  Or
where.  I close my eyes again and surf through a thousand possibilities.  Slowly I begin to be aware
of the who, what, where of my own baseline reality.

<P>I am sitting on the couch.  How in the name of god did I get on the couch?  I started on the floor... I
try to frame a question, ask "How long?"  M answers "Ten minutes".  Wow!  What a ride.  I
reintegrated rapidly and asked about how I got on the couch.  Apparently I stood up, looked around
for a few minutes, then sat on the couch.  I don't remember any of it.

<P>The next time I tried salvia it was while already tripping on 2CB.  That experience is written about in
another report, <A HREF="../2cb/2cb3.htm.html#salvia">here</A>.

<P>After those two experiences I was awed by salvia, and a little anxious about diving back in.  The
next time I used salvia was immediately previous to a 2CB trip I'd planned.  That experience is
chronicled in this report, <A HREF="../2cb/2cb5.htm.html#salvia">here</A>.

<P><A NAME="salv2"></A>A week or two later some friends of mine decided they were ready to meet salvia.  I brought my
supply of leaf to their home and introduced them to it.  They both had interesting, positive
experiences.  Afterward, though I hadn't been planning to do so, I was struck by an urge to try it
myself.  I loaded up a portion and smoked it rapidly, lying back as I was finished.

<P>I'm in a movie, or a contest or some damn thing... It's a very confusing, yet somehow familiar
feeling.  I felt my reality was divided into three sections of 120 degrees apiece.  I almost felt as if the
experience were taunting me.  It was there, yet not quite there.    After a few minutes I broke the
trance and sat up.  The experience is so elusive...

<P>Later that night, after I returned home, I suddenly decided to try salvia again.  This is fairly unusual
for me, as I am not prone to impulse tripping.  However, I felt that if I tried again I would be able to
go deeper than my first attempt.  I was alone in the house.  I loaded and smoked another bowl as
quickly as possible.

<P>I was knocked free of my space/time location and into salvia space.  As usual, I immediately tried
to establish where I was rather than paying attention to the experience unfolding.  As usual I missed
a lot of it.  I do remember being a young child, near christmas time.  There was a mothering
presence nearby.  I do not know where I was at.

<P>I also thought a friend of mine was in the house with me.  After I came out of it, I was very surprised
to find she wasn't there.

<P>A few minutes after smoking the salvia my phone rang.  It took me three rings to figure out what it
was.  I answered it and stumbled through taking a message for my roommate.

<P>Afterwards I walked around my apartment trying to make sense of my experience.  I realized I was
very angry because both of my trips that night had been so elusive.  I am not sure if I was simply
frustrated or if my anger was somehow caused by the salvia.  It is unusual for me to get angry about
such a thing.

<P>These four trips into salvia space have left me just as puzzled (if not more so) than my first set of
experiments.  Salvia is very strange.  It doesn't feel like a drug as much as a key to another reality.
As I mentioned in my last salvia report, I feel I am bringing back only a small percentage of any
given experience.  My experiences while already under another drug's influence have been the most
impressive, and I intend to explore this further.  Salvia promises to continue to amaze me for a long
time.<CENTER><P><A HREF="4salvia.htm.html">Previous Salvia Experience</A> <A HREF="salvia3.htm.html">Next Salvia Experience</A></CENTER>
