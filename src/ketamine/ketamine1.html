<P>After a considerable amount of time spent looking for it I finally came across a sample of Ketamine. This psychedelic is very different than most, being in the dissociative anesthetic class. I had read many reports, some positive, and some negative about it. For a while, it was my most sought after agent. Fittingly enough, by the time I actually came into contact with it, my interest had dropped considerably. Still, I was curious to see what it was like and form my own opinion.

<P>I debated the method of ingestion for a while. I hate snorting things, but I had only heard a few reports of oral ingestion, and they indicated that it took considerably more substance for the same intensity of effect. Since I had only a limited amount of material, I opted to snort it up. 

<P>I inhaled the first line, then waited for ten minutes. At the end of that time I was feeling only threshold effects. I snorted another line, then waited for two more minutes. By that time, I was feeling definitely altered. As the effects were becoming manifest I snorted two more lines, then lay down to let it do its thing.

<P>Lying on the floor in the dark I waited to be sucked into the fabled K-Hole. The room was dark. My eyes were closed. Behind my eyelids I began to sense a larger space. After a while, this space began swirling gently, as if images were about to coalesce out of it, but this never happened. Once or twice, my perspective seemed to switch, so instead of being on the floor looking up into a space, I would seem to be floating in that space, looking down on the floor. I felt very floaty and kind of weird.

<P>As I lay there, my mind began to drift. The K was working on images that were stored in my memory. I began visualizing characters and scenes from the newest Star Wars movie, which I'd seen a few days before. This wasn't any kind of actual visual, just sort of an amplified visualization. My mind played over the images imprinted from the movie for a while. The space theme seemed very much in line with the Ketamine.

<P>My mind touched on other images too, in its wandering. I had a brief flash of what I would call paranoia, except there was no real fear attached to it. I just had this mental picture of the police coming for me, arresting me for following and researching my vision of god. It was almost entirely devoid of any emotional content, just a strange play in my mind.

<P>At some point I decided to snort the last line of K on the plate. I got up and managed to get the necessary apparatus together. I was pretty whacked at this point. With eyes open everything looked swimmy and distorted, like I was underwater. I felt like my body was an alien form, something unfamiliar and quite strange. I managed to snort the last line and returned to lying on the floor.

<P>During this time I was listening to an ambient compilation. Analog synthesizers morphing into one another provided a fitting soundtrack to my brain morphing and oozing into unfamiliar configurations. My hearing seemed to be particularly acute. I could hear tiny movements from the next room, crickets chirping outside and more. I continued to drift, tripping mildly and letting my mind wander where it liked.

<P>Eventually the effects began to subside to a certain degree. I decided to get up and move around a bit. Even more than before I felt my body was an unfamiliar form. In fact, I felt like I was embodied as Jar Jar Binks, moving in the strange, swaying way he did in the Star Wars film. Very odd, and more than a bit disconcerting. For one thing, I found Jar Jar completely annoying...

<P>As I came back I began making comparisons to other psychedelics and assorted psychoactives. K reminded me a little bit of nitrous and a little bit of Salvia. I could see how they were all considered dissociatives.  It also relaxed me and gave me some of the same vertiginous feelings GHB does. Especially after I became more and more focused in my body I felt very light and floaty. The downside to this was that every movement of my head made me dizzy and a little nauseous. 

<P>After a while I was mostly recovered. I decided to get online and check some email. While I was doing this I remembered hearing that K could be excellent for sex. I decided to masturbate to test this theory. Masturbation worked, but was not particularly enhanced. 

<P>I continued to feel a bit nauseous as I worked in front of my computer. After a while I decided to smoke a tiny bit of pot to see if it could banish the lingering nausea from the K. As I hoped, it worked very well, allowing my stomach to relax and helping stop the spinney feeling that was leftover from the K.

<P>Sleep was fine and I felt fine the next day, no signs of a significant hangover.

<P>An interesting first experiment. Overall, K did not particularly impress me. I have heard some particularly impressive things about it. DM Turner called it "the most intense, bizarre and enjoyable psychedelic". This was not my experience. I found it to be only mildly psychedelic. There were no real visuals to speak of, although I had a definite sense that they were waiting just out of reach. I did get the feeling it could be much more impressive if it was done while under the influence of another psychedelic. I will be performing such an experiment soon, I believe.
