<P>I had been curious about using Ketamine in low doses for a while.  Most of the people I know who used K used it in small "bumps", usually as an adjunct to MDMA, but often by itself.  The only others I knew who regularly used large doses were others interested in the deeper aspects of psychic exploration.  While this is obviously my primary interest, I thought it might be interesting and worthwhile to see what it was like in small doses.  

<P>So one evening at my friend T's house I decided to take the plunge.  I still had a slightly negative opinion of K, after my last experience and having had someone steal it from me.  I figured a low dose experience might be a good opportunity to reevaluate the drug and possibly change my relationship with it.

<P>T prepared the material.  We each did a small line, 25-30 mg I would guess, but it is hard to say for sure.  We had been smoking high grade cannabis all night and were fairly high at the time.  I snorted it a little too hard and it hit the back of my throat and started to drip, which I had been trying to avoid.  I drank some water and sat very still in an attempt to ward off the nausea I was starting to feel as it burned my throat and made me want to gag.

<P>It crept in slowly, subtly changing the familiar cannabis high.  I began to feel very light, floaty, almost but not quite dream like.  Over the next fifteen or twenty minutes it ramped up to full intensity, which wasn't particularly intense.  As it "peaked" I was feeling very much altered, but not really tripping.  The floating sensation was more defined and I felt as if I was up somewhere near the ceiling of the room.  The room itself seemed to change its aspect somewhat, curving in on itself in some strange way.  

<P>T and I talked about the feeling and our other K experiences.  I played Asteroids on my PDA while he watched.  I felt separated from everything to some degree.  I understand why they call K a dissociative.  It definitely seems to disassociate one from their surroundings.

<P>Before long T fell asleep.  I woke him up and sent him off to bed, then crashed myself.  I had no after effects the next day.

<P>This experience definitely confirmed my first impression of lower dose Ketamine trips.  They are not that interesting, especially compared to the utterly bizarre possibilities of a fully immersive K trip.  However, the physical symptoms and after effects were also much more bearable.  Still, I don't see adding K to my stable of regularly used substances anytime soon.
