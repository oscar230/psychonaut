<P>Over a month had passed since my last party and my last acid trip. I had intentionally been taking a break from both for a while. When I felt a sufficient amount of time had passed I chose a fun looking party and planned to attend it with some friends. We bought tickets, spent an hour driving there and another forty minutes waiting for it to start, only to have it broken up by a bunch of dog wielding police. After some discussion, we called the info line from a payphone and they said the party had been combined with another party in another town. 

<P>We drove to the second party, only to be told that there was no connection between the two parties. They were nice enough to give us a reduced ticket price, however. I cursed the first promoter and paid for a second ticket.

<P>The rave was sparsely attended when we got there, but it filled up quickly with kids from the party that had been busted. I spent a few minutes wandering around talking to people before taking two hits of acid. It was colored gels and it tasted terrible. I spent the ten minutes or so until the stuff melted in my mouth wincing at the foul taste. L had taken one hit of some different, but equally foul acid just a few minutes before I took mine. 

<P>We wandered around waiting for the acid to work. L asked if I was feeling anything, but I wasn't yet. She wasn't either and speculated that she might take the second hit soon. Ten minutes after that (maybe twenty five minutes after I took the hits) I was starting to feel a familiar tension in my chest and upper body. L still wasn't feeling much. 

<P>We wandered around, talking to people and checking out the party. The music in both rooms was mediocre. I was starting to trip but L still felt almost nothing. Finally she took a second hit maybe forty minutes after the first. Less than five minutes after that she started feeling it strongly. 

<P>I tried to dance a few times, but couldn't get into it. I didn't care much for either of DJs spinning, I felt off balance and I just couldn't find my groove.

<P>We walked to the wall and sat down on a platform. We cuddled against each other as the trip came on. The trip started leaning toward the erotic and suddenly we both wished we were at home... instead we just sat around, leaning against one another and tripping out.

<P>As I approached the peak I realized I was tripping hard. L was also tripping hard, as hard as she had ever tripped. I laid back and closed my eyes and found myself suspended in space, nearly egoless. I was only vaguely aware of my surroundings, identity, etc. I opened my eyes before I went too far out.   

<P>We sat there, tripping out for a while. We had a strange, rambling conversation and basically just tripped out on the environment. I was fairly happy to be where I was, but L felt a bit uncomfortable, mentioning several times she would like to leave. Of course, neither of us could drive, so it wasn't much of an option.

<P>Sometime just after the peak a house DJ came on that wasn't too bad and I got up to dance. I got into what I was doing and my mind wandered from strange thought to strange thought as I danced. I speculated on the nature of our collective allegiance to the beat and the somewhat strange motions that comprised most ravers' style of dance. It seemed to point toward some weird insectile group/hive mind forming out of the rave experience. Destroying one's ego to join into a collective consciousness driven by the beat.

<P>It was a fun thought. The music was decent and I was finally able to loosen up a bit and have fun dancing. The release of energy and the exercise felt great. I pushed my body further than it wished to go, wishing again that I just kept it in shape. The fatigue only intensified the trip. 

<P>After a bit I went to find L. She was dancing near the edge of the crowd. We sat down for a minute and then went to get some water. She ran into a friend from work and I talked to some random party kid. After a few minutes, the jungle playing in the room spoke to me and I had to start dancing. My short break and the switch of styles had served to improve my dancing. 

<P>After a while I moved back to the house room and danced there. L and I met up and split up several times over the next few hours as one of us wandered into the other room to dance or talk to someone. I was still tripping hard and I felt really good. Mostly I was dancing, stopping to catch my breath a few times and once to find water.

<P>After several hours the party was winding down and we decided to leave. We walked out into the bright, early morning sunlight and watched the sidewalk undulate and form patterns. We were still tripping pretty well and planned to walk around some nearby parks for a few hours until we finished tripping.

<P>Less than a block away we found a nice spot to sit, next to a pond. It was really pretty and would have been quite tranquil except for a pump running a few feet away. We watched the world breathe in typical acid vision. I was getting huge trails off of moving objects, and occasionally off of stationary ones. 

<P>Several hours passed as we noticed trees and pretty rocks and other things, moving from interesting point to interesting point over time. For a while we watched slugs crawl through the dewy grass, several squirrels approached us, apparently looking for a handout. The sky and mountains in the distance were breathtaking. We talked, about us and parties and various other things. It was fun to be outside on a lovely morning with L, feeling very in love.

<P>The trip wore on and eventually began to wear itself out. We found a diner to have some breakfast at around 9:00 a.m. Omelets and fried potatoes helped ground us and wipe away the last trippy aspects, leaving only a vague stimulation barely above baseline.

<P>Finally we drove home. We spent another hour reading to one another, showering and unwinding. Finally we went to bed and had sex before falling asleep. 

<P>The night and the trip were both fun and stress relieving, even though they didn't work out as planned. L and I both tripped much harder than we expected to, which was nice in many ways. Getting out and dancing to celebrate Being and watching the world go by with my lover had made me feel great about life and things in general.
