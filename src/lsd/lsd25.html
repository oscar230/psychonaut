<P>The night of the burn L and I decided to take LSD.  As we stood around the Man waiting for him to go up I pulled out the nearly empty vial containing the evening's LSD supply.  With the aid of a glowstick I dropped a small amount on each of our hands, which we then licked off.  We waited for the burn and for the acid to kick in.  After thirty minutes we decided to take a little more and I put a bit more on each of our hands, which was then licked off.  Finally the burn started.  It was anticlimactic and seemed uncoordinated.  L wasn't feeling anything from the acid we had taken and I was feeling only minor effects.

<P>We milled around after the burn, looking at the fires and listening to fireworks explode.  I was feeling a sense of lightness and an elevated mood and appreciation for the beauty of everything around us.  L was still feeling nothing.  We decided to walk back to our RV and see what was left in the vial.

<P>By the time we arrived at the RV I was tripping, albeit mildly.  I was in a great mood, laughing at everything and feeling quite euphoric.  Everything had a mild psychedelic gleam to it, color and depth perception jacked up a notch or two.  I sat down in the light and looked at our vial, and realized why we weren't feeling much.  There was nearly as much acid left as when we started!  I thought we'd taken more but the liquid didn't want to come out of the nearly empty vial.  I took the vial apart, then cut it in half and L and I split the contents.  All told we probably took three to five hits apiece.  L also took about two grams of GHB around this time.  She got up to go to the bathroom and yelled out" Oh shit, it all just hit me".  I laughed and smiled.  I felt it was going to be a great night.

<P>We spent another ten or fifteen minutes getting ready to go out and meet the night.  By the time we left I was tripping quite nicely.  I was seeing intense trails off of every moving object and the distant lights twinkled and called out to me.  As we headed out onto the playa I chanced to look up and was rewarded with one of the most intense and awe inspiring visuals of my tripping career.  The entire sky seemed to be made of some psycholuminescent fluid that was melting all around us.  I turned to my companions (L and M) and said, with great relish "The sky appears to be meltingï¿½"

<P>We headed towards the large rave.  There we found one of the biggest, most bad ass sound systems I have ever seen.  We all moved up near the front and started dancing.  I felt magical, liquid, unencumbered by anything, just another part of the beat.  We stopped from time to time to hand out candy, take pictures or just check out something bizarre as it walked or rolled by.  We ended up directly in front of the huge speaker cones, shivering in ecstasy as the sounds boomed out and caressed our beings.

<P>After an hour or so of this L suggested we walk around and see what else the city had to offer.  We headed out onto the playa, back towards where the burn had occurred.  Small to huge fires were burning in several places.  All sorts of people were wandering around, enjoying the intensely strange energy of the night.  We stood alone, looking at the city curving around us to either side, unsure of what to do or where to go.  

<P>Out of the darkness we heard music, approaching.  A huge artcar festooned with Christmas lights rolled towards us, its sound system blaring a semi familiar piece of music.  It took me a moment to identify it as the Kink's "Lola".  As far as we could tell everyone on the car (ten or fifteen people) was singing along.  It was indescribably strange and hilarious.  I thought I was going to fall down from laughing so hard.

<P>We decided to go back to the RV to refuel on water.  As we walked back I proposed an experiment to L.  "Maybe we should ride the Fox tonight as well?" I asked.  She said this sounded like a good idea to her.  When we arrived at the RV I produced two capsules of 5-MeO-DIPT, each containing between 8 and 12 mg.  She swallowed the smaller capsule and fifteen minutes later I took the larger one.  The night was still young.

<P>While we were preparing to leave again, two more of our RV mates arrived.  They were rolling quite hard and talking a mile a minute.  We updated each other on the evening's festivities so far, sharing a few laughs at some of the strange things we had seen.  After twenty minutes to a half hour our friends left the RV and we were alone.  

<P>We discussed what we should do from there.  The night was fascinating but COLD and the RV was warm.  Should we stay or should we go?  Suddenly the foxy methoxy kicked in and it was decided.  Almost out of nowhere I became incredible randy.  I grabbed L and began kissing and caressing her.  She responded in kind and we jumped up into the top bed to explore one another and this new combination.

<P>Our kisses and caresses were intense and it didn't take long before we were more or less naked.  We laughed at the taste of playa dust on each other's skin.  I felt incredibly close to and in love with L.  Every touch was ecstasy.  I closed my eyes and watched new realities pulse into being with every touch.  Our friends returned, which distracted but didn't stop us.  When they left again we dissolved once more into a seemingly unitary being.  One mind, one body, exploring itself.

<P>The sex was incredible.  5-MeO-DIPT and LSD are two of my favorite sex enhancing drugs and the combo was excellent.  As I approached orgasm it began to blossom deep within me.  I perceived it happening, recognized it for what it was and nurtured it into being.  L and I came less than a second apart, explosively.  It was almost too good to be true.

<P>Afterwards we lay together, talking, kissing and cuddling.  Our time in the desert had helped me to fully realize just how important this woman was to me and I didn't hesitate to tell her.  I felt totally open emotionally, totally in tune with her and totally happy.  We began fooling around again and before long we were having sex again.  This time L beat me to orgasm and we had to stop, as it was too intense for her to continue.  We laid together for a while longer, relaxing and enjoying the gentle remains of our trip.  

<P>Finally we climbed down and got dressed.  I noticed that the walls would begin to contort and flow if I didn't look directly at them.  Everything in my peripheral vision was alive and moving, but when I focused on something it would become still.  After some discussion we decided to head out and see what was going on outside.

<P>We picked a direction almost at random and walked in it until we found a sound system with some decent beats.  We stopped and danced for a bit, then moved on.  Every time we found a nice beat we would stop and pay our respects, throwing down and getting funky for a few minutes.  I really enjoyed watching L dance.  She has her own style and lately has become a first rate dancer.  As I looked at her I would get strong feelings of love that came in waves.

<P>The night was winding down and so were we.  Exhausted from a week of experimentation and celebration and a long night of dancing and making love, we headed slowly back to camp.  Once we arrived we debated going to bed right away, but decided to watch the sunrise before calling it a night. I walked around camp looking in vain for something to smoke pot out of before finally accepting it was not to be.  We climbed on top of our RV and watched the sun rise over the playa, talking about Burning Man and our future together.  It was a magical ending to a magical trip and a great way to end my second Burning Man.  I can only hope that future years are as awesome.
