<BODY BGCOLOR="BLACK" TEXT="WHITE" LINK="DODGERBLUE" VLINK="DARKORCHID"><P>One Saturday 
afternoon I was sitting around after work. It was one of those rare days that I work on 
the weekend, and my shift had left me somewhat stressed out. After some consideration I 
decided to smoke some 5-MeO-DMT to try and discharge my stress so I could relax and enjoy 
the rest of the afternoon. On several previous occasions I have noticed that after smoking 
5-MeO I am completely at peace and in a wonderful state of mind, and this is what I hoped 
to accomplish.

<P>I put some ash on the screen and then loaded a small amount of 5-MeO on top of it. I am 
not sure of the amount, but it was one of the bigger doses I have tried. It was probably 
between 6-12 mg. I had recently moved to a place with a fenced backyard, which afforded me 
some privacy, so I decided to smoke it outside.

<P>I laid down a towel on the grass and sat down to meditate for a few minutes before 
ignition. After I had spent a few minutes breathing and calming my mind I began melting 
and vaporizing the substance. I inhaled most or all of it in one big hit. Holding my 
breath I lay down and took off.

<P>As I lay down, things were beginning to vibrate around me. By the time I exhaled, the 
world was shimmering and folding around me. 5-MeO seems to bring about the perception of 
subtle energies pulsing through everything. This often appears to me (and did this time as 
well) as a folding, puzzle like pattern, more experienced than seen or felt. Behind my 
closed lids the familiar puzzlebox played itself out. With open eyes there were a lot of 
trails and doubled images as the wind blew the tree above me back and forth.

<P>I felt as if I were melting into the Earth and merging with its spirit. I was out of 
body, but very aware of the natural surroundings that made up my immediate environment. As 
I have previously, I felt a sense of cosmic union, of being one with all creation. There is 
a sense of  "This is the way it really is", or at least of being closer to the Real. 
Needless to say, this is a wonderful feeling.

<P>I would like to note that the 5-MeO experience is very difficult to put into words. 
This is more or less true of all entheogens, but 5-MeO is particularly ineffable. 
Nothing I say here can effectively convey the overwhelming speed, intensity, or depth of 
the experience.

<P>As I started to come back it felt a little like what I imagine being born is like. I 
started to become more aware of my environment, in a "normal" way rather than the "cosmic" 
perceptions I had been enmeshed in moments before. I remembered who I was and what I had 
just done. I took a few deep breaths and was infused with a deep joy. As I had hoped, my 
stress had been excised completely. I just lay there, enjoying the subtle afterglow and the
beauty of the day for another ten minutes or so.

<P>After that I went inside to read a little and figure out what I wanted to do with the 
rest of my afternoon. It was a really beautiful day, probably the nicest so far this year. 
It occurred to me that I still had a few hits of LSD left and I decided to take them. 
Although I do not usually trip on impulse, it was such a beautiful day and I was in such a 
great mind set after my 5-MeO shot that I felt it was an opportunity not to be missed.

<P>At 4:00 p.m., approximately 40 minutes after my MeO excursion I put 3 drops of liquid 
acid on my tongue. I then went outside to lie in the sun and await its onset. It came on 
gently over the course of an hour. By the time my roommate came out to tell me he was going
to the park (an hour or so after takeoff) I was beginning into the trip proper. I felt 
the familiar acid muscle tension (hard to describe, but I am sure most acidheads know 
exactly what I mean) and the clouds were multidimensional and full of color and movement.

<P>As I went deeper and deeper into the trip I was assailed by sexual thoughts and feelings.
From time to time I would be hit by a wave of sexual desire that I can only describe as 
overwhelming. All other thoughts were driven out momentarily by an intense upwelling of 
desire. The first hour or two of the trip was mostly ruled by sexual feelings and thoughts.
I also thought about some ideas presented in a book I am reading called The Occult, a 
History by Colin Wilson, including the origin of the word occult. My mind kept returning 
to sex, and one particularly convoluted train of thought linked up female sexuality and the
pursuit of occult knowledge. LSD does interesting things to one's thought patterns and 
associations.

<P>Visually everything seemed wavy, shimmering and warping in my field of vision. Beautiful colors and patterns were present on most surfaces. The world seemed to ripple and flow around me while I melted into it. My ego was tattered and awareness of who and where I was came and went throughout the afternoon. I was somewhat twitchy, but this wasn't unpleasant. My body seemed to move into positions dictated by the acid rather than any conscious urge.
I was hyperaware of my environment and felt very merged with nature. The feeling of the 
sun on my face, the wind on my skin, the sounds of birds and the big trees around me all 
added up to a lovely experience. I was in a warm, friendly and peaceful place mentally and 
felt things couldn't possibly be better.

<P>I did a balloon of nitrous and launched into a blissful, ego less state in which I felt 
that I was simultaneously aware of numerous points in my lifeline and their relation to the 
present moment. I had a sense of purpose to all the pieces of my life, a momentary 
awareness of what I was moving towards. A nice feeling.

<P>About this time (a little more than two hours into it) I decided I wished to get beyond the sexual 
tension I was feeling, which was becoming more and more uncomfortable and insistent by the 
minute. I went into the bathroom and masturbated. This had the desired effect as it broke
the tension and allowed me to move on and focus on other aspects of the trip. While inside
I noticed the familiar alien runes pattern covering most every surface, much more prevalent
than it had been outside. I theorize that this is because there was less light in the house
than outside, and acid visuals seem more present in dim light.

<P>I went and sat back outside and reflected on how wonderful a day it was and how great 
things had been for me in general lately. Around this time my roommate returned from the 
park. We chatted a few minutes before he left again to go visit his parents. I returned 
outside and sat for another fifteen or twenty minutes in the backyard, just grooving on the
beauty of the day as the noises of the neighborhood filtered over the fence to me.

<P>I did another balloon and watched things vibrate and shimmer as my head expanded into 
blissful realms of nonbeing for a few minutes. I find nitrous oxide to be only mildly 
interesting by itself, but it interacts with psychedelics in a wonderful fashion, 
intensifying and expanding the sensations into strange and wonderful configurations. 

<P>After that I figured it was time for some music. I went inside and put on Eat Static's 
Epsylon, which I had purchased the day before and hadn't yet heard. Spacey noises and 
tripped out beats began pouring from the speakers as I lay down on the couch. I got quite 
involved in the music, and for the next twenty five minutes or so it was the only thing I 
was aware of. I probably would have spent the whole album there listening so intently that 
nothing else was present, but for the fact that I had to use the bathroom. After I returned
I still enjoyed the music but the moment was lost, so to speak, and I was unable to sink 
into it the way I had previously.

<P>My roommate returned around 8:00 or 8:30. We sat around and chatted about how we had 
spent our respective afternoons. We listened to some more music, and eventually smoked a 
little pot. I offered him a balloon, which he accepted and then he got ready to go out for 
the evening while I sat on the couch and enjoyed the tail end of my trip. 

<P>After he left for the evening I smoked some more pot and listened to music. At 11:00 or
so I decided to go out and meet him and some friends of ours at one of the local bars. By
this time I wasn't feeling much but a little stimulation from the acid, but I was quite 
stoned. At the bar I hung out, danced and watched my friends play foosball. The remains 
of the acid gave me a fair amount of energy, and I was able to dance for quite a while 
before tiring out. After we had enough of the bar we walked home and crashed out. I sat up
and thought for a while, finally going to sleep around 4:30 a.m. I awoke around 10:00 on 
Sunday morning, feeling slightly tired but excellent otherwise. 
 
<P>This was a superb trip, probably one of my best acid trips ever. The afternoon had a 
timeless, eternal quality to it. As in the best experiences, it seemed to last forever 
while I was in it, but afterwards, upon reflection, the time seemed to have flown by. 

<P>I think the 5-MeO excursion immediately previous to the acid had a profound effect on the
outcome of the trip. After smoking it I was in a superb state of mind. I will likely 
repeat this experiment in the future, both with LSD and with other agents. I may also try 
the same thing with Salvia or another short acting agent to see if it yields similarly 
positive results.
