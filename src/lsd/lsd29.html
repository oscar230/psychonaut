<P>Several friends from out of town came to visit me recently. We decided to go out for a night on the town, a night of dancing and psychoactives. After much discussion we all decided on a small dose of LSD. It was late and my recent experiences with LSD had all been weird, so I decided to play it safe. For the first time in a long time, I chose to take a single hit.

<P>I waited until we arrived to blast off. Shortly after getting inside the party I took my hit of acid and walked around to await its onset. I talked to my friends, both those that had come with me and several others I ran into there. I danced, I hung out, I did the usual party thing.

<P>The acid took a while to come on. A single hit isn't much after you've experienced it a few dozen times. It gave me a little energy, gave everything a slight glow, lifted me up just a tiny little bit. It was trippy, but it wasn't much of a trip. 

<P>Worst of all, it not only didn't do much to enhance my dancing it actually interfered. I felt clumsy in my body as my slightly expanded awareness seemed to race all over the place, preventing me from focusing at all. I was too high to pay attention, not high enough to forget to pay attention. I felt caught in some sort of halfway state, off baseline but not high enough to really experience what was going on with the trip.

<P>We left early, missing the last DJ or two. I was tired, disappointed in my just over threshold trip and the party itself was weak beyond belief. On the trip home I noticed I was tripping a little harder than I had thought, but still not enough to make anything useful of it. I ran at the mouth for the entire ride home, just a stream of consciousness rambling, born of acid stimulation and a lack of anything better to do. I am sure my companions were quite sick of it by the time we arrived homeï¿½

<P>We smoked some pot, which finally made the trip go somewhere. On the tail end of the trip I was finally feeling a substantial effect. Strongly colored by the pot, of course. I felt like I was moving through space, floating on a cannabis carpet. It was lovely.

<P>The night wasn't a total waste. I enjoyed spending time with my friends that I don't get to see often enough. I found out that it wasn't really worth my time to take a single hit of acid. I got some exercise. Not terrible, just not very interesting.
