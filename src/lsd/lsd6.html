<BODY BGCOLOR="BLACK" TEXT="WHITE" LINK="DODGERBLUE" VLINK="DARKORCHID"><P>Recently, 
for the first time in my life, I came across a quantity of acid.  Always in the past when I 
had some it was enough for one or two trips maximum.  This time, however, I had come across 
enough to do a series of experiments and really work with it, something I have been eager to 
do since I became serious about entheogenic exploration.  First however, I had to test it to
ascertain its relative potency. 

<P>After work I put a single drop on my tongue and sat down to meditate. A couple of times 
during the meditation I thought I was getting little alerts.  After the half hour was up I 
was definitely feeling slightly altered, but I wasn't sure yet if it was the acid or just 
the meditation.

<P>I went into the living room to listen to some music.  I put on a cd and sat down.  I was 
restless, and kept going into the bathroom to do a pupil check (see if my pupils were 
abnormally dilated, a sure sign).  At about T+40 a friend of mine dropped by to borrow 
something.  We stood around and talked for ten minutes or so.  By the time he left, I was 
definitely tripping.

<P>I spent a few minutes fiddling with the stereo and then put on the Chemical Brothers Dig
Your Own Hole. As I was sitting on the couch listening to it I had some weird twitches in 
my legs, like the last time I had tried LSD.  I sat back and closed my eyes.  There was an
occasional flash of visuals, and as my mind wandered I was able to visualize my thoughts 
quite easily. With eyes open, everything seemed to stand out in relief and there were 
colored auras vibrating on the edges of everything.

<P>After the disc was over I decided to take a shower.  While I was in the bathroom I 
noticed patterns creeping out of the floor.  The patterns I get on acid are distinctive 
and very cool.  They look like alien runes covering everything. I spent some time staring 
into the mirror, watching myself breathe.  I felt very in touch with my body and its 
processes as I watched my chest expand and contract. The same patterns I had seen on 
the tile floor seemed to flash in and out of existence on my skin as I inhaled and exhaled.
A very cool effect.

<P>After I had my fill of that I got in the shower.  Showers tripping on LSD are always a 
pleasure, and this was no exception.  I was fairly focused and managed to finish the shower
in a reasonable amount of time.

<P>Afterwards I felt great, very relaxed but still tripping.  I lay down in my room for a 
while and just chilled out.  I thought about the trip, acid in general, and various things 
of that nature.  I quite enjoyed just lying there quietly.  

<P>About this time (T+4) I decided to smoke some pot.  I rolled a big joint and lit it up. 
I took three or four hits before putting it out.  It had been a while since I smoked pot so 
I was quite stoned.  The acid and marijuana synergized well, as the trip intensified a bit 
and changed in character.  

<P>After smoking I had a tendency to zone off, and enter a trance of sorts. It is different
than the mushroom trance, although it is difficult to explain how they differ.

<P>I decided to look something up in DM Turner's Essential Psychedelic Guide while sitting 
there.  It took me a minute or two to find my copy. I read what I was looking for, then 
continued to read other parts of it.  This is one of my favorite books about psychedelics, 
a very handy basic guidebook with lots of good info. I quite enjoyed reading it while 
tripping.  The letters seemed three dimensional and had colors bleeding off the edges of 
them.

<P>After setting the book down I sort of zoned off again, and spent the next ten or fifteen
minutes just sitting there, rocking back and forth staring alternately at the wall and into 
space. After I sort of "came to" I decided to call a friend and ask him a question.  Once I
got him on the phone I stumbled through asking him the question I had called to ask him, 
taking about ten minutes to do so as I continued to go off on tangents.  I'm sure he found 
it humorous.

<P>Once I was off the phone I decided to listen to more music.  I put on Soul Coughing and 
sat down on the couch to enjoy it.  They are one of my favorite bands and I really got into 
the music deeply.  About halfway through the disc my roommate and a friend of his showed up.
We relit the joint I had rolled and passed it around.  

<P>I decided to eat something and got some strawberries out of the refrigerator.  They were
delicious. Still hungry I decided to eat some actual food and fixed myself a pita with 
hummus. By this time, though I was still feeling the acid, I was mostly just really stoned.
After eating I decided to go to bed (T+6 hours)

<P>In the dark I had a surge of visuals.  I felt infused by plant energy.  Since LSD is 
such a transparent psychedelic, it seems that whatever you mix it with (marijuana in this
case) greatly influences the character of the experience.  For this reason, I think LSD is
a good entheogen to do mixtures with, and I have a number of experiments along those lines 
planned.

<P>My thoughts turned inward at this time.  I often get quite introspective on an LSD trip. 
In this case, I was thinking a lot about some negative things in my past.  One incident in 
particular was haunting me and I decided to finally take some action and resolve it at the
earliest opportunity. 

<P>I fell asleep about an hour after I went into bed, or seven hours after ingestion.  I
slept for 8 hours and awoke feeling pretty good.  My sleep felt light, and I was slightly 
tired the next day.

<P>A good trip.  I accomplished my purpose of calibrating the relative strength of the acid. 
I enjoyed myself, which is always spiritually affirming.  And most importantly, I finally 
resolved to work out a problem that had been poisoning me for years.  The very next night I
actually did so, and I have felt a burden lifted from my shoulders since.  Again entheogens 
have shown their ability to force me to confront deeply buried conflicts and bring about a
resolution, one of their greatest benefits in my opinion.
