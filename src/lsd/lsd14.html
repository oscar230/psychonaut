After more than a month I decided it was time to try 5-MeO again.  I was planning on going to a Tool concert later in the evening and taking some acid, and I thought the 5-MeO shot might serve as a good predose, to prepare my energies for the upcoming trip.  I prepared a small amount of 5-Meo by placing it on top of some ash in my glass pipe.  I then heated it slowly and inhaled the vapor.

<P>As I set the pipe down I knew I had underdosed.  I felt the rising energy and 5-MeO "hum", but subtly enough I knew I wasn't going to be catapulted into 5-MeO space.  I closed my eyes and laid down anyway in an effort to go with it and see me how far it would take me.  I got a hint of the elaborate geometric dimension that 5-Meo can allow access to, but just a hint.

<P>I was disappointed at this largely failed attempt, and decided I might try again later.  I decided to see if I could harness the peaceful state that 5-MeO engenders to help my meditation.  I sat down and began counting breaths.  I found myself in a strange state of consciousness.  My time sense was dilated, making it seem that an interminable stretch of time existed between each breath.  I was also still feeling a fair amount of body effects from it, making it even harder to concentrate.  I started to wonder if I hadn't tried to meditate too soon when a knock came at the door, giving me a good reason to cut it short.

<P>After my visitor left I decided to try again.  I again loaded what looked like a sufficient amount into my pipe and vaporized it.  This time I received even less effect than the first time, getting just a trace of consciousness change.  I was quite frustrated at my inability to break through, and decided that the next time I was to try it, I would use a much larger dose.  

<P>My roommate arrived home and I offered him a hit.  He hadn't tried it since my first experiment, back in February.  He was eager to check it out again and decided to take his hit in the living room.  I gave him an amount that looked to be a little more than what I had just done.  He smoked it as I watched him.  Within a minute he said "Wow, that was cool" or something along those lines.  I knew I had underdosed him as well.  He had gotten more effects than his first try, but still nothing too impressive.

<P>By now I was getting frustrated.  My caution had kept me from experiencing the full spectrum of 5-MeO effects too many times.  Even my more intense experiences still fell short of what was possible according to people I had spoken to and compared notes with.  I decided to throw caution to the wind and go for it.

<P>I loaded up a lot, easily twice what I had smoked before.  I smoked it very carefully, doing my very best to vaporize it all and not burn any of it.  I got all the material in one big hit.  The last bit was pretty hot, and irritated my lungs a bit.

<P>As I held my breath I knew I had gotten a good dose finally.  The effects manifested more rapidly than they have previously and by the time I exhaled I was already seeing/feeling/experiencing reality as a set of folding "puzzles", each of which represented a certain vector of cosmic energy.

<P>There are not words for the experience that followed.  At least, no words that I know.  I was completely enmeshed in cosmic existence.  There was no thought at all, certainly no thought of a human existence on an earthly plain.  I was simply a spinning pattern of energy in an infinite sea of energy, experiencing everything, all at once without the intruding illusion of temporality or time.  "Ah-ha, so THIS is how It isï¿½"  

<P>I think I remember opening my eyes, seeing the room around me and integrating it into my colorful spinning vision of Light.  Sounds from outside and the other room played into my brain, becoming part of the infinite dance unfolding within me. My life seemed to make sense, discrete events falling into place as parts of a seamless whole.  I glimpsed the master plan, seeing that it was good.  I had this feeling that time and consciousness are two parts of a seamless whole, that "reality" is just one way of looking at a subset of available data.  All this and more transpired in a space of time less than ten minutes.

<P>I came back completely awed.  My earlier 5-Meo experiences had been only a teaser.  Even my smoked DMT trip had only hinted at the complexity and scope of the full experience available through the tryptamine flash.  I was literally blown away.  Coming back was like being reborn, remembering that I existed as an embodied human being in a concrete universe.  I was completely thrilled by the trip, and eager to share it.  As soon as the body tremor subsided (which took another ten minutes at least) I loaded a big hit for my roommate to smoke.  He did so and was pulled into an experience that he called "amazing".  I smoked what he had left in the pipe, finding myself returned to a level higher than my first two attempts of the day, though no where near the ecstatic revelation of my previous hit.

<P>After that I jumped into the shower to get ready.  After all, I still had a Tool show to attend.

<P>I love music of all types and Tool is one of my favorite bands.  I don't listed to much music that heavy, but they display an intelligence and inventiveness that many of their "heavy metal" peers lack.  Plus, for my money, you don't get much more psychedelic than Tool.  I was eager to see them live, to see how they translated the intensity of their recorded work on stage. I had never tripped at a concert before and figured that a Tool show would be nearly ideal for a first time.

<P>After we arrived at the venue we went and found a place to sit.  I waited until Tool came on to drop my two hits.  Almost immediately after ingesting them I realized I should have taken it earlier to maximize the length of time I would be tripping while they were playing, but it was too late for that.

<P>Tool was awesome.  It wasn't until the fourth song or so that I started to feel the acid.  Their powerful music poured over me, awaking powerful emotions.  The projection screen behind them displayed strange, surreal images.  At one point they had a Timothy Leary video clip going.  Images of people, fractals and strange geometric forms flashed on the screen in turn.  I found it beautiful and satisfying.

<P>I quite enjoyed the music.  I do find that I actually enjoy raves more than rock shows, simply because raves are inherently participatory, while shows are spectator events.  You watch a rock band perform, but you dance your ass off and become part of action at a party. Still, everything has its time and place.

<P>The music was intense and emotionally powerful.  By the time they finished their set I was peaking on the acid.  The sound was incredible, dense and powerful and magical.  I didn't want it to end, but of course it did.   Afterwards we spent twenty minutes exiting the venue amid a ton of foot traffic.

<P>In the car on the way home I had a chance to sit quietly and reflect on my life and my last few trips.  Recently I had talked to my mother and received confirmation of a repressed memory that had come to the surface on a precious acid trip.  This had been a big relief, and a major step in rectifying the event with my life and moving beyond it.  My mind centered on that revelation and it's emotional impact as well as my earlier 5-Meo trip and my deepening interest in rave culture.  I felt at peace and happy.  

<P>By the time I arrived home I was over the peak of the trip.  I listened to music and played with Photoshop and tried to take notes on my 5-MeO experience.  The acid made it difficult to capture my thoughts before they flashed on to the next idea and I was having a hard time typing.  Basically my mind was not in a verbal/written mode and it was hard to force it into one.  I gave up on that and just played with abstract images and listened to Future Sound of London and Tool until I was ready to sleep.  I ate a bagel and some yogurt and smoked some pot to relax and chill out.  I went to bed a little after four, approximately 7.5 hours after I ate the LSD.   I woke up at 2:00 p.m. the next day and felt fine.


<P>I enjoyed taking LSD at a concert.  It enhanced my experience of the event.  However, it wasn't as cool as taking a high dose trip at home or a similar dose at a rave or out in nature.  I wouldn't hesitate to do it again at a concert for a sufficiently cool band, but it certainly wouldn't be a priority.  The 5-MeO may or may not have positively enhanced the trip, it is hard to say.  However, it was certainly rewarding and illuminating in its own right.
