<P>After my initial Ketamine exploration I was left unimpressed but very curious.  Based on my research and intuition I had the strong feeling that if I combined K with another psychedelic it would be a much more impressive experience.  Since I had a few hits of LSD left over from a recent party I decided to combine the two and see what I could see.

<P>At  10:00 p.m. I took two hits of acid, leaving one in reserve.  I spent some time getting things ready for the rest of the trip.  I got a glass of water, prepared the Ketamine I would be snorting, set up some CDs to listen to and cleared a space on the floor to lie down in.  The plan was to snort the K as I was peaking on the acid, approximately two hours into the trip.

<P>After forty minutes I was feeling the acid fairly strongly.  I was anxious to do the K and time seemed to pass very slowly.  I sat in the dark listening to some ambient music to set the mood.  I was getting almost no visuals off the acid, so I decided to go ahead and do the other hit around 11:00 p.m.

<P>While I was lying on the floor I felt a lot of sexual energy.  I considered masturbating, but chose not to do so.  My mind was preoccupied with sexual themes and feelings.  I thought that the Ketamine portion of my trip might end up being a psychedelic porno, and the thought amused and intrigued me.

<P>I tried meditating while I was waiting for takeoff time.  My mind was too agitated to focus much and my breathing was a little odd.  I chalked it up to anxiety about my impending experiment.  The effects of the acid accelerated soon after I took the third hit.  I began seeing more patterns and closed eye visuals.  I also began to experience some ego dissolution and my mind began turning to cosmic matters.

<P>At 11:45 I made my final preparations.  As I looked at the plate with the K I wasn't sure I would be able to snort it.  My body felt a little strange and awkward.  I looked at the K, took a deep breath and exhaled it, then leaned over and snorted the first two lines.  I sat up and waited a short time (thirty seconds perhaps) then bent over and snorted the last two lines.  

<P>I was feeling some effects as I sat back to wait for it to kick in.  I didn't have to wait long.  I began hearing humming, buzzing noises and the room began to recede and become swimmy.  I was struck with an urge to lie down, which I did.  I reached up to shut off the light and a few seconds later I was far gone.  

<P>Imagine reality as a sink full of water.  We live all of our lives in this sink, never suspecting that there are miles of plumbing beneath the sink.  Within minutes of snorting the Ketamine, the plug was pulled on the sink and I was off, down the drain, flying through the pipes at a tremendous speed.  

<P>My consciousness seemed to leave my body and sail up to the ceiling, where it flattened out into a disc like shape.  The disc began to spin and become elongated.  Before long it tilted on its side and funneled itself back into my brain.  

<P>Strange noises, like bizarre ambient music, surrounded me and propelled me through the experience.  These sounds melded into one another and morphed into strange and beautiful forms constantly.  There were few or no static tones, everything seemed to be constantly changing and reconfiguring.

<P>I was disoriented and overwhelmed, but there was little or no anxiety.  I had a definite feeling that maybe I had "done it", pushed things too far and perhaps passed the point of no return.  I often have this thought on Salvia, and it is usually terrifying.  On K this thought was remarkably free of anxiety.  I just sort of accepted it and moved on.

<P>Images, ideas and themes from many of my past trips came together and seemed to fit into a vast tapestry.  Like many of my mushroom trips, I also experienced reality as it was presented in several books and movies I had recently been reading and viewing.  I had the feeling that I had finally figured it all out, that I had reached some penultimate state of being from which everything became perfectly lucid.  I felt like I could do anything.  Reality and my own consciousness seemed completely plastic and malleable.  Time and space both seemed to be meaningless abstractions that I could manipulate at will.  I seemed to be moving backwards and forwards in both time and space, seeing and experiencing many strange things.  I remember having the thought "Reality is the artifact, you are the builder", a message very similar to many of my mushroom trips.  Leading up to this I had a series of ideas and images go through my head that illustrated this point.  The message seemed to be, literally "You can do anything".

<P>As I began returning I became more and more aware of the room and the data of my senses.  I was completely blown away.  I was still far gone, but as I returned I began correlating the strange noises to things I was actually hearing.  Crickets outside, moths buzzing against my window, breathing and sleep noises coming from the next room.  I continued to just lie on the floor and think about what had happened.  Unfortunately, as I returned to my individual perspective, many of the fine details of the trip escaped me, much like the return portion of a Salvia trip, though not to the same degree.  Salvia usually leaves me with just vague impressions and a few unconnected images.  With the K, I felt like I retained the "gist" of the experience and many of the highlights, but lost a few scenes and much of the detail. 

<P>I turned on a light and sat on the couch contemplating the trip.  I noticed a spider crawling along the wall in front of me and began watching it.  As I did I began thinking about how it must perceive reality and how its perception differed from my own.  I felt like it could somehow feel me perceiving it, and that I was somehow picking up on its perceptions.  This led me to think about us sharing reality, thinking of reality as a collaboration of all beings and all consciousness.  At that point I had a sudden flash of inspiration of the universe as a piece of art of incredible complexity, created by a master artisan.  My life has been a search for understanding of this idea, and I felt like this was a major step forward, an answer to the question of "What is the nature of reality" and a step towards understanding it and the real question of "Who is the master?"  
 
<P>I eventually put on some music, the Future Sound of London album Lifeforms (an incredible piece of music and highly recommended for psychedelic listening) and smoked some pot.  I felt pretty good, but still a little spacey and unfocused.  I enjoyed the relaxed feeling and increase in visuals the pot gave me.  I continued to think about the idea of the universe as a work of art.  It felt very right and I liked the idea very much.  My mind continued to come up with strange and interesting concepts as I sat there.  I felt very creative as my mind roamed over several story ideas, philosophical concepts and other such topics.

<P>The Ketamine trip lasted almost an hour and half, with another hour or more of substantial effects that weren't quite out of this world.  After that I still felt spacey and discombobulated but mostly down.  My stomach was a little funny until I smoked the pot, at which time I felt fine.  Thank the gods for the anti nausea effects of cannabis!  I stayed up listening to music and smoking pot until about seven a.m. I was able to sleep with little difficulty.  I awoke five hours later and was up for the day, feeling a little tired and slightly out of it, but otherwise fine.

<P>This trip fulfilled my expectations of what Ketamine could do and then some.  I was literally blown away.  The only thing that I have done that was more intense was smoking Salvia extract on LSD, which was much less comprehensible.  I feel that the trip was fruitful and enjoyable.  It is definitely something I will repeat if I ever run across any Ketamine again.  It reminded me a bit of Salvia and of Nitrous, but it was definitely its own thing.  I can also see how it could be addictive.  It feels great and the sense of power and near perfect understanding is quite wonderful.
