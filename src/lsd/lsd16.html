<P>I decided to spend Thanksgiving tripping this year.  Since most of my family lives halfway across the country I was free of familial obligations.  I talked to a friend that also had no other big Thanksgiving plans and he decided to trip with me.  He (we'll call him J) showed up around 10:00 a.m.  At 10:30 I dropped three clear gels and he ate a sugar cube with three hits of liquid on it.  My roommate M was present, but not tripping.

<P>Within fifteen minutes of dropping M's parents showed up.  They sat around and chatted with us for a while.  I began to feel a sense of heightened awareness and a familiar "spacey" feeling from the acid as we sat there chatting.  They had decided to forego the usual family get together this year and told M he should feel free to bow out if he felt like it.  After twenty minutes or so they took off.

<P>At this point M decided he'd rather trip with us than spend the day watching football with relatives.  He took two hits of liquid and joined in our journey.  

<P>By now I was starting to trip.  I was getting bright trails off everything that moved.  I stood up and began dancing to the music we were listening to.  I really like dancing on acid.  It gives you a nice energy and you can sort of "see" where you need to put your hands and feet.  I visualize what I am doing in my head and it's easy to stay a step ahead of your self in order to keep it flowing.  J was watching me and complimented me.  He is an awesome dancer and it meant a lot to me to hear him say that, since he is the person who inspired me to actually work on developing my style and skills.

<P>Another friend of ours showed up.  He began telling us about his trip the previous night, then launched into an extended discussion of various trips, his opinion on various things, and assorted chit chat.  No one told him we were tripping and I don't think he was aware of it.  He sat around for close to an hour, talking to the three of us.  As he sat there my trip intensified.  By the time he left I was into the peak.

<P>Tripping during the day has a different energy than tripping at night.  Even though I was still dealing with a lingering case of sinusitis I felt good and full of energy.  On any surface I saw quicksilver acid visuals in bright daylight tones, similar but different than the hypersaturated neon colors I usually get on acid at night.  The visuals were less apparent in the daylight, but definitely there.  

<P>We listened to a few different songs but the music didn't seem to be as absorbing as it could be.  It was a beautiful day outside so I wandered out to sit on the porch and soak up some sun.  It felt wonderful to be out in the fresh air.  We decided to go for a walk since it was unseasonably warm.

<P>We walked out of the house and down the street to a nearby park, found a spot under a big tree and sat down.  It was one of those perfect days, when everything is right with the world and within your soul.  I couldn't have been happier.  We sat in silence for a while, just absorbing the beauty and majesty of the moment.  I watched jets fly overhead, seeing thousands of shades of color in the vapor trail they left.  J was watching the sky in absolute wonder, watching it ripple and flow like the surface of the ocean, declaring it to be the most impressive acid visual he'd ever seen.

<P>Time seemed to stand still as we sat there.  Day tripping was relatively new to all of us and we discussed the differences between tripping during the day versus night, and at a rave versus other, more sedate circumstances.  

<P>We sat in the park for hours, talking about various things and dancing around from time to time.  We talked about using psychedelics responsibly, the rave scene, dancing, philosophy and whatever else came to mind.  I really enjoyed spending time with M and J and felt like the trip was a sort of bonding experience.  It occurred to me that this was one of the best Thanksgivings in memory.

<P>After three or four hours we headed back to our house to get some food and smoke some pot.  As usual the pot sort of bumped the trip back up a notch or two while overlaying its own warm, fuzzy signature.  We all agreed it had been a wonderful day well spent.  We listened to Soul Coughing and watched the sun go down as the last of the acid slipped away.  After a while we headed over to J's house to spin some records and chill out.  M and I headed home around 10:00 and I sacked out around 1:00 am.  I woke up feeling great.

<P>This was a great trip.  It served as an excellent chance to spend time and bond with two good friends.  I felt close to both of them and really enjoyed the time we spent together.  I have always found acid to be an excellent catalyst for bringing people closer.  It isn't as reliable as MDMA, since it's easy to drift off in your own world on an acid trip, but in its own way it is excellent.  On this day, it worked wonderfully.  It was a near perfect day.  I felt very in touch with the spiritual nature of everyday reality.  The trip was profound in a quiet, calm way.  No flashy insights into the nature of reality or shattering personal revelations, just a warm, friendly day spent with good friends, enjoying the sublime beauty of a warm winter day.  The acid helped me to relax and absorb the essence of the day without feeling like I had to "do" anything.  I was content to simply be, and be happy.
