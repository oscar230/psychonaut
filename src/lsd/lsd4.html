<P>The weekend of March 7 I went out of town to visit friends. Upon awakening at 10 a.m. I did my
daily meditation and waited for my hosts to rouse. We went to breakfast and returned home around
noon. My host T had some LSD and we decided to journey together with it. We sat around and
waited until our breakfast had mostly digested and then ingested our sacraments. I took one hit (50
micrograms?), he took a half.

<P>While we were waiting for the acid to kick in I started to talking to M, a friend of T's I had just met.
We talked about electronic music, speech synthesis, Burning Man, and a host of other topics. I
enjoyed the conversation immensely and was definitely starting to feel the acid. After roughly an
hour I was at a definite +1 (Shulgin) when I excused myself to use the bathroom.

<P>By the time I returned from the bathroom things were sparkling and breathing slightly. T's wife J
arrived home from a dance class and we decided to go sit in the hot tub to relax. It happened to be
snowing outside, but we were not to be deterred.

<P>We got ready and walked to their hot tub, which was outside. We climbed into the warm water and
started the jets. It was very relaxing and felt great. I sat in the tub, covered up to my shoulders
with warm water. The cold air on my head and shoulders contrasted nicely with the warmth below,
and the acid only enhanced the novelty. My visuals were starting to come on more, so the snow
falling all around us was edged with colors, reds and golds mostly. A tree next to the tub seemed
charged with energy. I was wonderfully cognizant of how great it was to be able to sit in a
snowstorm in shorts and enjoy the beauty of the day while doing so. If you ever get a chance to trip
in a hot tub while it is snowing, I highly recommend you make the most of the opportunity.

<P>While I was sitting there, I was thinking about my life, and how it had been going lately, especially
about a significant promotion I had just recieved at work. I felt like this trip was a sort of reward for
following the path and allowing my life to unfold without interference. Since I have become serious
about my spiritual development my life has gotten steadily better. It seems as if I am guided by a
divine force of some sort. I reflected on the fact that everything has seemed to work my way, even
when it doesn't seem to at the time. I feel confident that the future hold great things and I am
very happy.

<P>After quite a while in the hot tub (enough to become rather pruney) we went inside to swim a little.
This was the first time I had the opportunity to swim tripping, something I had wanted to do for a
long time. The sensation of the water moving over my body was great and I really got into it. While
floating on my back, eyes closed, I had the most intense visual of the trip. I saw what appeared to
be a tunnel made out of or lined with eyes, leading to a light source far above. I lay there grooving
on this for some time. After swimming for a while we went back to the hot tub and then headed for
the sauna.

<P>The sauna was very nice. The heat felt wonderful and it seemed to intensify the trip a bit. As we
sat there drying off and sweating, faces and figures seemed to be trying to crawl out of the
woodwork. These visuals never manifested into anything significant, but there was a fair amount of
movement and color present. After a bit we headed home.

<P>When we arrived I decided to smoke some cannabis. T handed me his bong and I took a few hits
and passed it around. Afterwards I sat on the couch and  sort of became one with it. The warm
water, hot sauna and marijuana relaxed me into a very mellow state. However, the trip was still in
full effect, and had actually intensified somewhat, likely due to the kind buds I had added on to it.

<P>Throughout the trip, my eyes closed visuals were very mild, sort of winking into existence for a
moment before sinking back into blackness. We listened to music, and I found the acid improved it
as it usually does, especially in combination with the marijuana. These are two of my favorite
entheogens to listen to music with, and they combine to effect a considerable enhancement. I was
able to get deeply into the music.

<P>Another friend of T's turned on the Simpsons after a bit and we watched that. As usual, I found TV
to be slightly disturbing while tripping. The commercials in particular were quite obnoxious. Luckily,
it was a small dose and one of the few shows I can tolerate. I was still glad when it ended.

<P>After that, I sat on the couch and talked to my companions about this and that. I was still tripping,
but it had faded to a slight "glow". I was, however, profoundly stoned from the pot I had smoked and
this left me feeling very tired. Since we had plans for the evening I went and took a shower to clean
up and wake up a bit.

<P>The shower was very pleasant, as showers tripping usually are. I found myself easily distracted,
and it seemed I was in the shower for quite some time, though I probably wasn't. Afterwards I dried
off and dressed for the evening.

<P>An hour or so later we took off for the evening. In the car on the way over T and I discussed our
respective views on entheogens (a subject we never seem to tire of) and noted that we were both
still tripping a bit. This was T+6 hours or more. We were going to another city nearby to watch T's
wife dance. The venue was this big arts and entertainment festival. I knew it would be an
interesting evening.

<P>There were thousands of people there, and it was quite crowded. I wandered around a bit, feeling
lost and a little out of place. There were free drinks and lots of food. However, I do not drink and
none of the food I saw was vegetarian, so that part of it didn't appeal much. M and I went to see
one of the performances, a group of Taiko drummers. They were incredible, and I wished I had seen
them earlier, while tripping a bit harder. Afterwards, I sat and people watched, which is fun
anywhere, in any state of mind.

<P>The rest of the evening involved a lot of wandering around this huge place, while my friends enjoyed
many free drinks. We watched J dance, which was cool. She is a great dancer, and I enjoyed the
show quite a bit. We finally left around 11:30 (T+ 9.5 hours), by which time I was feeling only the
very slightest trace of effect.

<P>The only other thing worth mentioning was a rather strange synchronocity that occurred a few hours
later, at a party of a friend of J's. Almost immediately after walking in I saw a picture on one of the
walls, drawn by one of the occupants. It was a sort of flower, surrounded by wavy colors and
almost mushroom like shapes. What made this remarkable was that I had seen this very same
thing on my last LSD trip, as a vision!  I didn't get an opportunity to ask any questions of the artist,
since she was in bed already. I hope to be able to talk to her again at a later date.

<P>That's more or less it for this trip. It wasn't a super profound trip, but it was very nice. As I said, it
felt like a sort of reward or celebration of my successes in life, both spiritual and secular. It was
nice to visit LSD again after 4 months, even at such a low dose.
