<P>A short while after my first 5-MeO-DIPT trip, I had an opportunity to try it a second time.  I received a small amount of the material in powder form.  Since I didn't have a milligram accurate scale, I measured out approximately eighty milligrams, split that into two piles and divided each pile into five lines that appeared to be of equal size.  I figured each pile would be approximately eight milligrams, give or take.  It wasn't the most accurate method of measuring out such a potent drug, but it was the best I could do given the circumstances. Each small pile went into a capsule.  

<P>When the day came I took my capsule shortly after awakening and doing my daily meditation.  This was around 3:30 p.m. My stomach was empty except for some bread I ate along with the capsule, to buffer its effect on my stomach.  My girlfriend L was present, but chose not to partake because she had a cold.  She left to get some juice and I jumped into the shower.

<P>I showered for maybe twenty minutes.  As I was finishing up, I observed a feeling of stimulation and alteration.  I was surprised that the drug had come on so quickly, since my first trip had taken forty minutes to start.

<P>I sat in the living room and put on some music to await L's return.  The drug effects were ramping up quickly.  Over the space of the next fifteen minutes I progressed from a slightly stimulated/altered feeling to nearly full blown effects.  My perceptions became subtly but definitely altered.  The music in particular sounded great and was very emotionally involving.  The feelings began to be so strong I felt a little nervous.  After all, this was a new substance and I had no way of knowing how accurate my measurements had been.  What if I had badly miscalculated and taken two or three times what I intended?  5-MeO-DIPT was such a novel substance that I had no idea what a toxic dose might be.  

<P>L walked in in time to distract me from this line of thought.  She asked how I was doing and I replied "Fine".  She said I looked like I was feeling it fairly strongly and I confirmed I was.  She offered a glass of juice, which I accepted, and we sat down together on the couch.  The effects at this point were very definitely present and felt subjectively much stronger than my previous dose of approximately 10 mg (although that dose had been weighed out by someone else in a similar fashion to the way I'd weighed out my own).  I felt slightly over stimulated and a little out of sorts.  Other than that the feeling was generally good, in a nonspecific way.

<P>L and I talked a while about whatever.  I found the conversation a little hard to get totally involved in.  I was distracted by the drug's effects and my own nervousness at the intensity of those effects.  As we sat cuddled on the couch we occasionally kissed or caressed one another.  Each time we did so I felt a spark of arousal.  Near the one hour point I decided to explore this a little further and began kissing L and trying to move things in a sexual direction.

<P>She responded at first, then stopped.  I began again, meeting the same results.  I began to be very aroused and continued to try and push things in that direction.  L continued to tease me, pretending to be unaware of my growing arousal.  Finally I realized what she was doing and asked her if she was teasing me or just didn't want to have sex.  She responded with a mischievous smile and indicated we should move into the bedroom.

<P>Once we got into bed I wasted no time.  I was incredibly aroused.  L and I began fooling around in earnest.  We spent twenty minutes or so in various forms of foreplay before having sex.  The sex was intense, almost animalistic, but I felt a deep emotional connection to L during the act.  It took only a few minutes before we came, simultaneously.  Afterwards, we lay there, panting and expressing the same basic sentiment: Wow.  

<P>As we lay there, talking and basking in the afterglow I began to be aroused yet again.  I drew her attention to my state of arousal and she expressed surprise at the rapidity of my returned ardor.  I asked her if she was up for another round and she replied that she surely was.  The second time was almost identical to the first.  Intense, short and accompanied by a feeling of deep love for L.  Afterwards L looked at me and made me promise not to take this around any other women.  I laughed and promised, and she reiterated it to make sure I knew she was serious.   

<P>I dressed and returned to the living room to listen to more music.  My stomach was a little funny and for a few minutes I thought I might vomit.  A little water helped considerably, leading me to think I was a bit dehydrated after all the exercise in the heat (it was a very warm day).  L asked me to let her take a short nap to recharge.  

<P>I sat in the living room and put on some music.  I decided to try a balloon of nitrous to see how it would interact with the 5-MeO-DIPT.  I filled a balloon and inhaled it in two or three inhalations.  It launched me into the characteristic nitrous state, not much enhanced.  A second balloon had similar results.  There was some visual enhancement and it lasted a little longer than a balloon sober, but overall it wasn't nearly as impressive as nitrous on a more traditional psychedelic like LSD or mushrooms.

<P>An hour passed and L got up from her nap.  She asked if I was hungry and I responded in the affirmative.  We decided to walk down to a sandwich shop near my house.  

<P>It felt great to be outside.  L mentioned that I looked "fucked up".  I asked if it would be obvious to someone who didn't know me and she told me it wouldn't.  She could tell because she was familiar with my body language and bearing when I was in a psychedelicized state.  I was still tripping quite hard at this point, though the sex had definitely taken the edge off and made the whole experience more manageable.

<P>The walk was quite lovely. I was with a person I love dearly.  The trees, sky and everything else were intensely beautiful.  Everything had a slight psychedelic gleam to it visually, not quite enough to be an actual visual, but definitely a slight alteration of perception in the visual field.  I felt upbeat, positive and happy.  The drug probably did not create this mood, but it certainly didn't interfere any either.

<P>At the sandwich shop we ordered, received our food and sat down to eat.  The food tasted great and my appetite was not affected in the negative by the fact that I was tripping.  As I was eating I noticed a peculiar looking person sitting at the bar.  He was dressed in an odd manner and his hair could only be described as ridiculous.  In my trippy state I found him fascinating and hilarious.  Luckily he was too engrossed with his conversation with a girl at the bar to notice my attention and amusement.  I watched this guy on and off for the majority of the time we were there and his image remains indelibly burned into my brain.  

<P>After we ate we decided to go downtown and people watch. I felt very happy to be with L.  My emotional state is probably best described as sappy.  It is a state slightly reminiscent of the MDMA state, yet distinctly its own.  I liked it.

<P>We sat downtown in the town square for an hour or so, occasionally walking to shops, enjoying the spectacle of humanity being itself in its many guises.  After some time we decided to walk home and relax there for a while.

<P>By this time I was definitely on the downside of the trip.  L and I took a shower together and afterward she prepared for work while I sat nearby, chatting with her about nothing in particular.  I felt very pleased to be with her, a continuation of my earlier sappy state.

<P>L left around 9:30 or so.  I was sad as she left and felt a little lonely.  My house was uncharacteristically empty, since my roommate and my daughter were both away that week.  I decided to walk to a friends house nearby to return a CD I'd borrowed some time ago and for some company.  Normally I am totally content to be by myself, but at that time I didn't want to be alone if I didn't have to be.

<P>I walked over to his house, still feeling definite drug effects.  Unfortunately he wasn't home, so I turned to return home.  As I walked home I let my mind wander, zoning off on tangents.  I walked down the opposite side of the street than I usually do and ended up walking past my house.  I crossed the street and went inside to relax.

<P>Once again I put on some music and decided to see how pot would interact with the remains of the trip.  I smoked a bowl of some low grade schwag and relaxed into its comforting embrace.  The pot synergized with the remains of the trip nicely.  It took the edge off of the remaining stimulation and increased the mild visual aspect of it considerably.  I decided to do my last balloon of nitrous and was pleasantly surprised at the interaction of the three drugs.  Unlike the first couple of balloons I was launched into a deep egoless state filled with pulsating, pixelized, abstract visuals.

<P>I listened to music for a while, occasionally smoking more pot until I felt ready to go to sleep.  Sleep came only with difficulty, despite the relatively large amount of cannabis I'd smoked.  Although I missed some sleep, I woke up the next day feeling good.  My workday was pleasant as I was in an elevated, positive mood.  The next day I was also in a better than average mood.  I am reluctant to assign this to the drug, but at least it didn't interfere with it or have any noticeable hangover or backlash, like the MDMA midweek "blahs" some people occasionally report.

<P>This was another good trip with this rare material.  I am certain that once "word gets out" it will become popular, and most likely banned.  Like MDMA it doesn't seem to be truly psychedelic, but it does have some psychedelic qualities to it.  It is definitely a sensory enhancer, it has some empathogenic qualities, and it does amazing things for sex. I look forward to future exploration of this unique compound.  I only wish I had a more accurate way of measuring dosage, since I am not sure whether the increased effects were due to a higher dose than my first trip, taking it at a different time of day, or some other factor or combination of factors.
