<P>At a small rave thrown by some friends of mine I decided to take some 5-MeO-DIPT.  I'd had good results taking it in those situations before and was looking forward to a good night out.  I took approximately 15 mg, maybe a little more.  I walked around and talked to some friends while awaiting the onset.

It came on strong, everything became a little more intense all of the sudden.  I was talking to a girl I knew when I really started feeling it.  The onset was a little like MDMA, some of the same rush and warmth.  It filled me with energy, which I expressed in movement, dancing in place while chatting amicably.  The music was good, the vibe was intense and it looked like it was going to be a great night.

Then the police arrived.  Helicopters overhead, three or four cruisers and the party was over like that.  I stood outside, shivering and irritated and discussed options for the rest of the night.  After some discussion we decided to go to a club and check it out.  

A friend drove my car there.  The ride over was a ride deeper into the trip, sparkles and energy and a deepening tryptamine signature.  I felt good, just irritated at the party being shut down.  When we got to the club I easily managed to navigate the entrance and paid my $5 to get inside.

The club was dead.  There was almost no one there, the music was gack and the whole vibe was unpleasant.  I tried dancing and forgetting the negative aspects but they refused to be dismissed.  The highlight of the club was one of my acquaintances rubbing my head.  It felt incredible, sending shivers up and down my spine in a most delightful way.

After twenty minutes or so of the not enjoying ourselves we decided to bail to another club.  This necessitated a drive across town.  Another friend drove, leaving me to relax in the passenger side and be fucked up.

And fucked up I was.  There was very visual element to the trip, seemingly characteristic foxy visuals, but more intense than expected. The 5-MeO-DIPT was strong and I wondered if I hadn't taken more than I thought or possibly accidentally taken some acid I had also brought with me.  The acid was missing but I am pretty sure that I had merely dropped it while fumbling through my pockets.  The possibility that I mistakenly swallowed it does remain, however.  

When we arrived at club number two, there was a huge line around the block.  Rather than standing in line we decided to head home, and home we headed.  

Back at my house we all relaxed.  It was my roommate M, our houseguest N and my old friend E.  We all chilled and bitched about the party getting shut down.  There was universal agreement that it had been pretty good until the cops arrived.  

Settling down for an evening in, E took a hit of acid.  He had taken some ecstasy earlier but wasn't feeling much of it at that point. N had taken some ecstasy as well and M took a pill to join in the fun.  I was happy with my 5-MeO-DIPT.  

We all sat around talking about dancing and techno and drugs and parties and whatever else came to mind.  The fact that everyone but me was on ecstasy definitely made it a warm vibe.  In particular, M was very chatty and friendly in contrast to his usually reserved self.  It is inspiring what E can do to help people break through self imposed barriers.

I danced around my kitchen and living room for a while, getting into the feel of moving and spent even more time watching M turn his hands into liquid and letting them flow.  We exchanged compliments and advice and generally geeked on dancing for a while.  It was good fun.

I noticed again the strange distortion to audio that I have noticed before on foxy.  My own voice and to some extent others voices sounded flanged and distorted.  It was an interesting but mostly unpleasant effect.  It didn't seem to affect the music too much, possibly due to the frequencies affected.  We were listening to techno, which is mostly bass and treble without a whole lot going on in the midrange.

I decided to see how 5-MeO-DMT and 5-MeO-DIPT would mix.  I loaded up a medium sized hit and smoked it down.  It walloped me into the light, leaving just a trace of consciousness in the room to observe the music and my body lying on the floor.  It was terribly funny and my mirth returned me in no time.  The 5-MeO-DMT seemed to expand the 5-MeO-DIPT into a whole other dimension, a beautiful multifaceted place full of light and peace.  It also stretched my time perception out to an unreal degree.  Minutes flowed by like hours spent alongside a lazy river.  It was nice, as usual.

We all wound down slowly.  Huddled around the stereo we talked about everything that popped into our heads, good times spent bonding with great people.  The evening wasn't bad, but I was still disappointed in not getting to dance, not getting to see my friend spin, and not doing what I had planned. 

I went to bed shortly after dawn, my sleep was somewhat fragile and I woke up feeling not particularly rested.  The fact that I was out for only a few hours affected this, I am sure.  After a good nights sleep the next night I was fine.
