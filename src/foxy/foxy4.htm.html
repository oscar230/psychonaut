<P>Since my New Year's Eve plans had disintegrated I decided to go to a party New Year's Day instead.  I hadn't gotten much sleep, but I wasn't about to let that dissuade me.  Around midnight of day one of the year 2000 I arrived at a new venue with my roommate M and a female friend of ours we'll call N.

<P>Inside I spent a few minutes checking out the scene.  The party had been going since noon and a lot of people were sitting down.  We all moved down to the front.  The venue wasn't too bad, a little seedy but not too crowded.  I spent a few minutes deciding what, if anything, I was going to ingest before settling on 15 mg of 5-MeO-DIPT.

<P>My capsule went down with a swallow of water and I started dancing a bit.  After ten or twenty minutes a new DJ came on, one of the headliners.  He started his set and it was awesome.  I began throwing myself into the beat with joy.  I noticed an extremely cute girl dancing near me and smiled at her.  She danced over my way and stopped to tell me I was a good dancer.  She was also an excellent dancer and I told her so. She thanked me and danced away into the crowd.

<P>With that kind of encouragement there was no stopping me.  The music took over and I lost myself.  I wasn't feeling much from the foxy methoxy, just a slight stimulation that could have been attributable to some ginseng and caffeine herbal energy concoction I had taken about an hour before.  I didn't let it concern me though since I was having a superb time.

<P>As the DJ's set continued my trip became more apparent.  I felt elevated and happy, my body felt like a well oiled machine and my dancing was as good as it has ever been.  More than a few people came up and complimented me and I noticed others watching me as I moved.  All of this fed my ego and pushed me higher and higher.  I didn't think I could have more fun.

<P>I noticed one person in particular watching me.  An attractive woman near my age was watching me from across the floor, smiling at me from time to time.  I began showing off a bit, really pushing myself and dancing in an expressive and spontaneous way.  I also moved over towards where she was sitting and made eye contact and smiled at her.

<P>She came over and complimented me and we started a conversation.  Before long she was blowing on my neck to cool me down.  I was thrilled.  I had just broken up with my girlfriend the night before and here there were not one but two attractive women flirting with me in one night…

<P>I kept dancing, stopping every few minutes to talk to my new found acquaintance.  She continued blowing on my neck and progressed to lifting my shirt to blow on my stomach.  I could take the hint and decided to move a bit myself.  I rubbed her shoulders and neck and then kissed her.  She kissed me back and I was in heaven.

<P>I was tripping pretty well by that time, but decided to push things a bit and took another 15 mg capsule.  This was approximately two hours after I took the first, but at the time I thought it had been closer to four hours, indicating I was probably tripping harder than I realized when I took the booster.

<P>She and I continued our flirtation, touching and kissing for a while whenever I would take a short break from dancing.  I was beginning to think I might go home with this girl.  She got up and left the dance floor and I followed her out to the lobby.  Once there I noticed she was avoiding making eye contact with me and was hanging with some guy.  I took the hint and went back inside.  After all, that other girl was still there somewhere…

<P>And besides all that the music was still speaking to the deepest part of me.  5-MeO-DIPT is a superb dance drug! I felt fluid, spontaneous and creative.  Every beat spoke to my soul in a deep and meaningful way.  I had a ton of energy and I really enjoyed expressing it on the floor.  I didn't want the night to end.

<P>I spotted the first girl I had danced with and we made eye contact.  She came over to where I was and we danced some more.  She was incredibly attractive and I was really enjoying her presence.  We didn't talk much, just danced and smiled at each other on and off throughout the night.

<P>As the second fifteen milligrams kicked in the trip got really intense.  Everything was becoming more colorful and animated and I was having a harder time carrying on conversations.  My body wanted to move and express all the energy that was pouring through me.  The feeling was up there with the best experiences I have had at raves, spiritual in a new and precious way.  I can't describe any better than saying that it felt like the universe was expressing its joy through me.  

<P>At a ridiculously early time (4:00 a.m.) they shut the party down.  This was about two hours after I took the second hit of foxy and I was extremely high.  I didn't want to drive anywhere but we were in the ghetto at 4:00 a.m. and I didn't see any alternative. Both of my companions were still tripping hard as well and I had more experience driving than both of them put together.  Reluctantly I got in my car to drive us home.

<P>The drive home was intense.  I was disgusted at myself to be driving tripping for the second time in two days.  I promised myself I would be more careful to avoid this kind of crap in the future as I concentrated on navigating us safely home.  Other than the fact that I was driving too slow and all the lights had smeary halos around them the drive wasn't too bad.  Even so, I was totally relieved to arrive home in one piece.

<P>I did notice an interesting thing while driving.  The music we were listening to in the car was oddly distorted.  The piano and guitar cords sounded like they were going in and out of tune, sort of wavering.  I had never noticed this with the music we were listening to and when I checked later while sober I noticed they didn't waver at all and seemed to be completely in tune. Apparently 5-MeO-DIPT has some interesting effects on sound, at least at higher doses.

<P>I had managed to suppress my trip a fair bit while driving us home but once we arrived I found I was tripping hard again.  I have noticed this before, that I can often suppress the effects of a trip to some degree if necessary.  It doesn't go away precisely, just recedes into the background a little bit.

<P>The walls were breathing so much they threatened to melt and whenever I closed my eyes I saw intensely colored geometric patterns.  If there was any doubt in my mind that foxy methoxy is a true psychedelic they were banished by taking a sufficient dose.  We put on some more techno and continued the party in my living room.  I danced around for another hour before I was finally able to sit down and relax.  

<P>M got out the bong and we smoked a few hits of kind bud to ease us into the morning hours.  It synergized nicely with the foxy, increasing the visuals and enveloping me in a sort of cone of silence but it had an interesting and unexpected effect as well.  The music sounded relatively normal, everyone talking sounded relatively normal but my own voice was incredibly distorted.  I couldn't even hear what I was saying.  It sounded echoing and metallic like it was going through some cheap digital effect.  It disturbed enough I had to stop talking for quite a while.

<P>After a bit I decided to take a bath to relax.  The warm water was nice and I spent the time reflecting on what a good time I'd had that night.  After I got out I decided to go to bed.

<P>Half an hour or so after I went to bed M came in, looking agitated.  He asked if he could talk tome and I told him of course.  He started to talk but kept stopping.  It was like he wanted to say something but couldn't say it. I got a little irritated and began trying to encourage him to speak.  He got more and more upset until he was more or less completely out of it.  I was concerned but also very tired and not in the best shape to deal with it.  I kept trying to talk to him but nothing seemed to get through.  He would respond to me then go back into whatever sort of trance he was in.

<P>For the next hour or two I watched M flip out.  He was moving in a way very similar to the way he had moved during his LSD + Salvia trip a few months before.  It looked a lot like a Salvia flashback.  It was making me distinctly uncomfortable and I was beginning to be paranoid about what it was he was about to tell me before he went completely loopy.  At some point N came in and we tried together to bring him back with mixed success.  He'd come out of it for a few minutes then go right back in.  He claimed to be in a great deal of pain, but couldn't tell me if it was emotional, physical or something else.

<P>After several hours he finally calmed down but still wasn't able to talk about it.  It wasn't until later in the day that he was able to tell me what had happened.  Apparently he had had an anxiety attack triggered by some negative thought he was having.  He had had anxiety attacks before, but never while tripping.  I apologized for not being very useful during the experience.  

<P>I didn't sleep much that day.  I had been feeling kind of down near the end of the trip anyway due to some unresolved feelings about L and I breaking up and the incident with M had really gotten to me.  I spent most of the next day in a funk, unable to do much but mope around and wish the day was over.  The next day, after I had managed to sleep I felt better but it took me another full day after that to fully recover.  It had been a long time since I had tripped twice in a row like that (not including Burning Man, which was a special circumstance) and it took a lot out of me.  Although I am glad that I did it I wouldn't do it again except in a very special circumstance.

<P>My appreciation of 5-MeO-DIPT grows steadily with each experiment.  The dose range given in TIKHAL seems low.  8-12 mg was nice, but not very distinctive. Doses from 15 mg and up seemed much more present and psychedelic.  I may experiment in the lower ranges again, but I definitely prefer the higher doses at this time.
