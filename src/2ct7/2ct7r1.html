<P>A sample of 2CT7 came into my possession recently and I decided to give it a try. It was a capsule containing 10 mg, a small amount but I hoped it would be enough to give it a taste. I swallowed the capsule late one quiet evening and sat down to await effects.

<P>They were slow to come on. Slow enough that I actually dozed off while waiting. I might have slept through the whole trip if my Friend T hadn't called around 1:30 am. This was almost two hours after I took it and I was definitely feeling something. But not much.

<P>I talked to him for a while, looking for effects the whole time. There was a slight but definite feeling of alteration, but nothing else. I didn't feel high, but I was off baseline. A classic threshold experience.

<P><A NAME="dmt"></A>I decided to smoke a tiny amount of DMT as an experiment. I smoked a few milligrams, just a light dusting. I definitely felt that much more than the 2CT7, but it was also just above threshold and faded quickly. I went to sleep a short while after trying the DMT.

<P>All I can conclude from this experience is that it takes more than 10 mg of 2CT7 for me to feel substantial effects from it. Next time I have an opportunity I will try more.
