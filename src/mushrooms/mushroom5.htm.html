Two weeks after my <A HREF="mushroom4.htm.html">previous mushroom experience</A> I decided to ingest the sacrament again to try and develop some of the feelings and ideas I had been awakened to.  So, Saturday night (after a 24 hour fast) I ingested ~5 g of powdered P. Cubensis mushrooms in orange juice.  This method is highly recommended to psychonauts who have a difficult time ingesting large amounts of mushrooms.

<P>I was alone in the house.  I had been preparing all day.  I cleaned the entire house, burned incense and spent a good part of the day in quite reflection on the experience I was to have.  Immediately before ingestion I did an invocation.  Immediately after I sat in the middle of my living room and practiced breathing.  When I started to feel an alert (in this case, a certain "heaviness" in my arms and legs) I went into my bedroom.

<P>I sat on the floor with a blanket over my knees.  I continued to concentrate on my breathing.  The mushrooms were taking effect rapidly.  The wood grain on my closet door was starting to swirl and flow.  The blanket over my knees was rising and falling with my breathing, but it looked like the blanket itself was breathing.  After a few minutes of these signals I turned off the lights and settled down to trip.As my visuals started to develop, so did a lot of audio hallucinations.  These sounded like cool synthesizer noises, squidgy filter quacks and zipzipzip type noises.  Like the soundtrack to an old Dr. Who or other TV scifi epic.  These noises got louder and louder and more and more dense.  They were fairly overwhelming after a while.   I sat there being pummeled by outer space noise for a fair amount of time.  I was a little disconcerted at the direction the trip was taking.  My ego seemed intact, my visuals were less impressive than usual and the noise was, as I mentioned, overwhelming.  I thought "Gee, this trip isn't going to live up to my previous one...".  That's my last "rational" thought for a while...

<P>The buzzing noises ceased (or became secondary...)  I entered a space that so far has been accessible to me only on deep mushroom trips.  As in my previous two mushroom voyages I felt as if information was being transmitted to me, or at least had become suddenly accessible.  This information concerned the very nature and structure of the universe, including my place in it.  

<P>I had a vision of the universe, containing itself.  I saw a series of calendars, clocks and other time measuring devices, the most perfect/accurate of which seemed to be the Mayan calendar.  Again I experienced the "time stop" phenomena as well as the mushroom voice.  Again it told me many strange and wonderful things.  Here are a few of those things.

<P>The mushroom, mankind and several other species on this planet (including dolphins) are all collaborating on a colossal project, the ultimate nature of which was somewhat elusive to me.  Most of humanity is completely unaware of their participation in this project, but the majority of the other players are fully aware of their own parts in it.  This project will reach completion in the year 2012.  It has something to do with time, consciousness, and perhaps leaving the planet or returning it to a pristine state.  

<P>I experienced, as I have a few times before, other people's lives.  I was told that other peoples perceptions were as valid as my own, even when they directly contradict mine.  This experience of other peoples existence included protohumans, my friends, and at least one famous figure.  It was like being granted access to THE library, the ultimate repository of knowledge.

<A NAME="forward"></A><P>I had a flashforward, to a <A HREF="../2cb/2cb6.htm.html#back">rave</A> I was planning on attending in the immediate future.  It was a momentary vision of dancing as music pounded all around me, my consciousness suspended out of time as the beat swirled around and through me.  

<P>Certain phrases kept forcing themselves into my consciousness.  The main one of these was "We are Toltecs dancing to birth the new millennium".  I have no idea what this means, although it is similar to a title of a book in a catalog I have.  Another was "This is the only dance there is", also similar to the title of another book.  And strangely enough, they both concerned dancing.  

<P>Song lyrics I had been listening to in recent days also went through my head.  For a short period of time I was convinced I was living in (indeed, that the whole universe was contained by) a Soul Coughing song called Blue Eyed Devil.  After that experience, I was convinced for a while that Soul Coughing's lyrics (if properly interpreted) explained everything.  I'm still not sure that wasn't an accurate vision.


<P>I had the feeling that mushrooms are preparation for death.  I thought that the moment of death would be similar to the time stop feeling.  I'm not sure how I reached this conclusion.  I remember saying "No man can be prepared for his own death, but I think I am"

<P>As I was having these numerous revelations I decided to use my tape recorder to take notes on the experience.  I managed to find it after fumbling around in the dark for a bit, but instead of turning it on, I just held it, grooving on the feeling of it in my hands.  I never did turn it on.

<P>I felt compelled to make noise.  I actually spent a good portion of the trip speaking, chanting, and generally going off.  I really regret that I didn't manage to turn on my recorder.  I think I will invest in a voice activated one in the near future to avoid this problem.

<P>After about four hours I began to come back to myself.  I realized who and where I was and began the process of integration.  I turned on the light and began thinking about what I had just gone through.  I was still tripping pretty decently, but I was out of the deep mystic trance state.  Even under bright fluorescent lights there was a lot of patterning apparent on the walls and ceiling of my room.  Everything was still rippling and breathing.

<P>I sat in reflection, quietly tripping like that for an hour and a half.  When my neighbors started playing death metal at inhuman volumes I decided to go and visit some friends.  We sat and talked and smoked a little cannabis.  At around 3 am I went home and went to bed, awaking the next day feeling great.

<P>As I had hoped this mushroom trip allowed me to gain more insight on some of the ideas of my previous journeys.  I was able to bring back more than ever before, although it is still extremely difficult to put most of it into words.  Mushrooms have rapidly become my entheogen of choice.  Each experience I have with them seems more powerful than the last.  I can only hope that this will continue and that my future experiences are as profound as these have been.
