<P>I recently took a very small dose of mushrooms at a party.  A friend offered me "a cap" and I said sure.  He gave me a small cap and two small stems.  The total weight might have been a half gram, no more.  I chewed them up and went about my business.  

<P>Within an hour I felt a mild euphoria and noticed a sense of lightness and a slight alteration in my visual field.  About this time we left the party we were at (a strange warehouse rave party with an open bar…) and headed to the friends house who had given me the shrooms.  The ride over was uneventful, but definitely tinged with an altered awareness.  The level of inebriation I felt was mostly annoying, I wished it would develop into something real or go away and it insisted on doing neither.

<P>At said friend's house we listened to some tracks he had done on his computer and shot the shit for a while.  Two of the people present were rolling and I sort of picked up on their vibe.  I got one of them to rub my head, a lovely sensation even when one isn't rolling.  When we left I noticed I was very fluid and felt compelled to bust a few moves in their kitchen on my way out the door.

<P>In the car on the ride home I was definitely chatty and keyed up.  I felt more strongly altered than before, but still very mild.  When we arrived home I smoked some high grade cannabis which pretty much obliterated the remaining shroom high.  I did have a few moments where I felt like the shrooms were still present, even magnified but after I smoked pot, but I was basically just stoned.

<P>Conclusion:  Very low doses of mushrooms aren't very interesting to me.  Not unpleasant, but not interesting.
