<BODY BGCOLOR="BLACK" TEXT="WHITE" LINK="DODGERBLUE" VLINK="DARKORCHID"><P>At around 9:30 PM I ingested approximately 5 g psilocybe cubensis mushrooms with some difficulty.  I hadn't eaten anything at all in at least 6 hours.  Immediately after ingestion I turned off all the lights in my house except the kitchen light.  I turned on the Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld and began reading the beginning of "Be Here Now".  Within 20 minutes the shrooms were starting to work, so I set aside the book and turned off the music.

<P>I layed down on the couch and removed my glasses.  I closed my eyes and watched the dark, rapidly moving eyelid movies for a bit.  After a while (approx 20 more minutes) I began to feel rather ill and retreated to the bathroom.

<P>Upon entering the bathroom I turned off the light and closed the door.  The darkness enveloped me and my visions began.  I leaned over the toilet but quickly sat back, as I wasn't quite ready to puke and the smell was less than pleasant.  

<P>In the dark there was no difference between eyes closed and eyes open.  Both presented a colorful animated field of flowing jeweled patterns.  I smiled and laughed at the visions.

<P>The urge to lie down struck me and I crawled into the bath tub.  I lay there for a while, staring into the darkness and thinking.  At some point in all of this, I had a revelation about my body image issues and I consciously "accepted" my body.

<P>I left the bathroom and returned to lying on the couch.  It occurred to me to smoke some rue.  The experience wasn't as powerful as I had hoped it would be.  I kept thinking about it, going back and forth about whether or not I should try it, when a voice spoke and said "Smoke the Rue".  I thought that was a pretty clear signal, so I loaded up a small pipe and took a number of large inhalations.  I put away the pipe and returned to the couch.

<P>Almost immediately I noticed a difference.  My visuals took on a deeper, more patterned aspect and their movement became more rapid and chaotic.  I became more and more involved in them and soon it felt that I had ceased to exist.  As the visual pattern became more three dimensional it covered me, began flowing through me and we merged.  For a timeless eternity (10 seconds? 30?) I was suspended in nothingness as nothingness.  My ego disappeared and I was lying in space, suspended and disembodied.  Everything was gone until suddenly I was returned.  I thought I had stopped breathing and immediately took a deep breath.   I lay there considering what had just occurred.  This experience reoccurred several times while I was lying on the couch.

<P>Again I was feeling nauseous so I returned to the bathroom.  The darkness of the room swallowed me up as I lay on the floor laughing and trying to vomit.  Everything seemed part of a huge cosmic joke.  I sat on the toilet, with my head on the tub.  I felt like I was being born and giving birth simultaneously.  The locus of my consciousness shifted several times and I felt like I was turning inside out.  

<P>I moved back and forth between the bathroom and the couch throughout the night.  At one point, as I was sitting on my couch, it occurred to me to ask for my "true name", or sorcerer's name.  I did so, and immediately received a reply.  The name I was given seemed very relevant (and still does).  I will not type it here, since I also got the impression it was to be kept a secret.

<P>I had a number of other interesting phenomena, including several reversions to an animal state, where I felt ruled by emotion and primal forces rather than intellect.  I was continually getting these tremendous waves of energy that manifested themselves as twitches forcing me to arch my body.  They were not unpleasant, but they were a little disconcerting.  I also saw myself as I think others see me.  That was interesting, to say the least.

<P>As the trip wound down I ended up lying on the living room floor twitching in response to the "energy waves" I was still feeling and trancing out until my roommates showed up.  This brought me down fairly rapidly and I was reintegrated within an hour of their arrival.

<P>This whole experience was quite interesting.  I feel that I have captured only a small portion of it in this report.  Of course, 10 words is too many to describe a psychedelic experience and 10 billion are not enough.  The experience was not exactly pleasant or recreational but it was very positive.
