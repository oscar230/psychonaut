<H2>What's New 1998</H2>
<P>December 21, 1998 - Wow. It's been a year since I went public with the page. Thanks to everyone for the encouragement I received. For my anniversary I've redesigned the site, made a new logo, and upated lots of stuff. And of course, new reports :) They should come more regularly now so check back often. <A HREF="mushrooms/mushroom12.htm.html">Paranoia & Hysteria</A> is a mushroom trip, <A HREF="lsd/lsd11.htm.html">Old School Trip</A> is an LSD + 5-MeO trip, and <A HREF="dmt/dmt8.htm.html">Metaphysical Lightning</A> is my first smoked DMT trip. <A HREF="lsd/lsd12.htm.html">Finding My Groove</A> 
covers an LSD rave experience, <A HREF="mdma/mdma3.htm.html">Raver X</A> is my first ecstasy at a rave, <A HREF="lsd/lsd13.htm.html">Candyflip</A> tells what happens when I combine MDMA and LSD, while <A HREF="lsd/lsd14.htm.html">Tool Show</A> is an LSD trip at a concert (with a predose of 5-Meo for good measure). <A HREF="dob/dob2.htm.html">DOB Goes to a Rave</A> is just that, and finally, three trips at Burning Man. <A HREF="2cb/2cb8.htm.html">Trip 1</A> is 2CB, <A HREF="mdma/mdma4.htm.html">Trip 2</A> is MDMA and <A HREF="2cb/2cb9.htm.html"> Trip 3</A> is 2CB again. Enjoy, and come back soon.
<P>September 18, 1998 - It's been a while...partly because I took a break from entheogens, and partly because I have been busy and lazy. Anyway, four new reports (more to come soon!). <A HREF="dmt/dmt7.htm.html">Ecstatic ReUnion</A> describes the 5-MeO trip I took to reacquaint myself with entheogens after my month long break, <A HREF="dob/dob1.htm.html">The Energizer Psychedelic</A> describes my first encounter with DOB, a rare phenethylamine, <A HREF="lsd/lsd9.htm.html">Mountain Rave</A> is about LSD at an outdoor rave and <A HREF="lsd/lsd10.htm.html">Trance Dance</A> is the story of a rather amazing LSD experience at another rave. Enjoy, and check back within the next two weeks for some more reports.
<P>July 15, 1998 - Lots of updates! It's been a while since my last update, as you may have noticed. This is because I have been quite busy and also because I decided to give myself a three month lag time between a given trip and the posting of the report on that trip. Updates will still come frequently, now that we are past the initial three month lag, they just won't cover such current events. Anyway, there is a new <A HREF="salvia/salvia4.htm.html">Salvia report</A> and two new LSD reports, <A HREF="lsd/lsd7.htm.html">Ginger Ale Afternoon</A> and <A HREF="lsd/lsd8.htm.html">Bicycle Day</A>. I hope you enjoy them, and keep the feedback coming!

<P>January 13, 1998 - Two important new links!  <A HREF="http://squeaker.cat.net/~donut/guide/cover.html" target="_top">The Essential Psychedelic Guide</A> is probably the best handbook for trippers I have ever seen, and thanks to the gods, is available online. <A HREF="http://squeaker.cat.net/~donut/scov.html" target="_top">Salvinorin: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum</A> is also available online now!  DM Turner's groundbreaking work on the usage of the active principle of Salvia. These are the only two works by the psychonaut that has most inspired me to share my experiences.
