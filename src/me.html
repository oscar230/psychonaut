        <h1>Me</h1>
        <p>I am in my mid-twenties, and male.  I live in a smallish college town in the USA.  I work in the computer industry.  I am self educated for the most part.  I finished high school, but chose not to go on to college.  I have a passion for reading and knowledge.</p>
        <p>I have one child, from a previous marriage.  I am single and heterosexual.</p>
        <p>The main focus of my life is my spiritual practice, the use of entheogens to explore the Mystery.</p>
        <p>My past was filled with a lot of negativity and turmoil.  When I was younger, I was fairly unhappy and extremely angry.  I managed to destroy most of what was good in my life through my anger and denial.  After a particularly nightmarish period of my life, I discovered spirituality and was able to turn things around for myself. Through my usage of these substances (and a lot of hard work) I have been able to pull my life together and become a happy and fulfilled person.</p>
        <p>This very brief description gives you a little background on who I am and where I am coming from.  My reports expand considerably on many of these points, as well as others.</p>
