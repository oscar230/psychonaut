<H2>What's New</H2>
<P>November 23, 2000 - A smallish update.  I updated the <A HREF="faq.htm.html">FAQ</A> to make it a little more navigatable and gave 
<A HREF="ketamine/ketamine.htm.html">Ketamine</A> its own section. There a few new reports coming soon and even more updates and enhancements on the way.  Stay tuned.

<A HREF="ketamine/ketamine3.htm.html">Cannabis + Ketamine - Antigravity Drug</A>. That <i>almost</i> clears out my backlog.  There won't be many more reports for a while, since I haven't been tripping much lately, but there is more good stuff coming soon. A final note.  I started an email list to notify people of updates. Go to egroups.com and look for the psychonaut list or email psychonaut-subscribe@egroups.com. Enjoy and keep those emails coming. They mean a lot to me.
<P>August 23, 2000 - Burning Man 2000 - I will be there.  If you will be there too, and wish to meet me, this is your opportunity.  Send me an email with where you are staying (what camp), post a message to me on the central bulletin board or swing by Erowid's theme camp (I won't be staying there, but I will be hanging out there from time to time)
<P>August 20, 2000 - Minor updates to FAQ and links sections, plus answered a TON of old mail.  So if you emailed me a while back and haven't heard back, check your mail (especially the old email addys!).  I still have a small mountain to plow through, but I am on my way. 
<P>August 19, 2000 - Here's a small update to tide everyone over while I work on an overhaul and larger update to the site. Several new reports (<A HREF="lsd/lsd27.htm.html">Near Disaster</A>, <A HREF="dmt/dmt19.htm.html">Oceanic Bliss</A>, <A HREF="dmt/dmt20.htm.html">Sex Magick and a Later Revisit</A>, <A HREF="ketamine/ketamine2.htm.html">Deep Into the K-Hole</A>, <A HREF="foxy/foxy3.htm.html">Foxy Rave</A>) and an updated <A HREF="faq.htm.html">FAQ</A>. I would also like to thank everyone who wrote me during my long absence of updates to beg me to update, tell me how much they like the page or just ask if I was OK.  I was indeed going through a difficult period and the encouragement and continued interest meant a lot to me. 
<P>February 22, 2000 - Well, we made it past Y2K.  As many of you noticed, it has been several months since the last update.  I apologize, but my life has been chaotic.
I haven't had much chance to work on the site.  I am uploading a batch of reports today, and working on an overhaul to the site, so keep checking in over the next few weeks.
Today we have<A HREF="dpt/dpt2.htm.html"> Smoked DPT</A> my first trip report from Burning Man 99. This is followed by<A HREF="2cb/2cb11.htm.html"> L's First Bees (BM 99 Trip2)</A> where L tastes the Bees for the first time, 
<A HREF="mdma/mdma10.htm.html">Proposal (BM 99 Trip 3)</A> where I propose to L and she accepts, and <A HREF="lsd/lsd25.htm.html">Acid Fox (BM 99 Trip 4)</A> where acid and foxy methoxy meet during our last night at Burning Man.
After I returned I had to try <A HREF="dpt/dpt3.htm.html">Oral DPT</A> and a short time later I experienced the extreme weirdness of <A HREF="lsd/lsd26.htm.html">The Trance</A> an LSD plus Salvia trip. I have lots more reports to upload in the next week or two, plus other changes.  And a last note: before you congratulate me on my engagement you should know L and I broke up at the end of the year. Condolences are similarly unnecessary.
