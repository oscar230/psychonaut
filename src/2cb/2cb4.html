<BODY BGCOLOR="BLACK" TEXT="WHITE" LINK="DODGERBLUE" VLINK="DARKORCHID"><P>While at work one Saturday (an unusual occurrence, I don't usually work weekends) I decided to trip later that night. I hadn't had breakfast, so I considered my fast started at 8:00 am, when I had awakened. After work I went to see a girl I was interested in. We'll call her J. 

<P>At that point in time, we were friends, but I definitely felt the potential for more existed there. While we were talking, I mentioned this, and we discussed it at some length. I mentioned to her that I was planning on tripping bees that night, and invited her to join me if she felt comfortable in doing so. She responded enthusiastically, and soon after I left, telling her I would return when I was ready to start.

<P>At 8:00 pm I headed to her house. When I arrived she had mellow lighting and a fire going. We ingested the 2CB (25 mg each) at 8:30. 

<P>At 9:10 it hit. And I do mean hit. It came on faster and stronger than I had ever had 2CB hit me, and I was concerned it might become overwhelming. Instead of gradually ramping up it was almost like flipping a switch. One minute I wasn't tripping, the next minute I was. 

<P>My visuals were pronounced with eyes open or closed. Eyes open there were trails and everything seemed as if it were somehow segmented. The trails were pronounced enough to cause a strobing effect, where images were doubled or tripled. With eyes closed, bright electric colors flowed in beautiful rippling patterns.

<P>We went outside so J could smoke a cigarette. The stars were very vibrant. The tree in front of us seemed very alive and full of energy. It looked as if it were made of thousands (or millions) of tiny jeweled or faceted segments. It was very impressive. 

<P>I decided it was time to try a balloon of nitrous. I offered one to J, and she accepted. I watched as she inhaled the balloon I gave her. She sat there for a minute or two, then smiled, laughed and said "Wow". She had never done nitrous while on another psychedelic and was quite impressed with it. 

<P>I filled and inhaled a balloon. As I held the gas in my lungs I slowly felt the nitrous energy suffusing my being/consciousness, seemingly from the bottom up. It felt as if I were sinking into the sensation. The weird flanging noises of the nitrous universe rose up to meet me. Crazy electric patterns surged back and forth on my closed eyelids, crashing into one another in flashes of candy colored light. My thoughts were unbound and flowed back and forth.

<P>I came back a grinning fool. J was still staring at the empty balloon in her hands in apparent wonder. I managed some profound comment like "Nitrous is the shit". I asked her if she would like another balloon, and she replied "Maybe later. It's a bit overwhelming". A fair assessment.

<P>We went inside and I sat down on the floor. It was much more comfortable than her couch. She sat nearby. We started talking about energy, and its various forms and manifestations. I mentioned that 2CB seems to be about energy, and that my trips on it seem to tune me into the energies around me. 

<P>Our talk was very easy and open. We talked about a few things we hadn't before and learned a few new things about each other. It wasn't as wide open as MDMA, just a gentle relaxation of barriers that allowed a more honest and easy conversation with someone I was already comfortable with. 

<P>J stood up and said she wanted to show me something. She put out her hand and asked me to touch her finger, which I did. At the point of contact there was a strong sense of energy flow between us. We moved around each other in a sort of dance. It was very instinctual. We could feel what the other was about to do before they did it. While we were doing this I couldn't take my eyes off of her. I was incredibly attracted to her and the whole thing was erotically charged. After ten minutes or so of this we sat down and resumed talking.

<P>About this time I decided to do another balloon. I filled it up and inhaled it, launching myself into a space where I floated tranquilly on waves of nitrous bliss while Fleetwood Mac sang about having plenty of time...I came back smiling at J. She said she had felt some of the energy from the balloon, and I told her I would have been surprised if she hadn't. She looked as awed by it as I felt. She did a balloon and came back smiling widely.

<P>I put on some music and sat back down in front of her. She told me her hands were cold so I took them in mine to feel. I held them and looked into her eyes, and she leaned forward and kissed me, our first. The bees have a great tactile enhancement, and with eyes closed, kissing produced some wonderful synaesthetic and sympathetic visuals. Beautiful, abstract skin visuals, like what your skin would see if it had eyes of its own...

<P>Over the next hour or so we simply layed on the floor kissing and talking. We shared some very personal things with one another. Some of the time we were silent, simply lying there holding one another. We traded back rubs (back rubs are incredible on bees!) and then just sat and talked until a friend of hers showed up. We hung out with a couple of her friends for the next few hours at which time I went home and went to bed.

<P>This 2CB hit me hard and fast. It was easily my most intense 2CB trip, and also one of my shortest in duration (just over three hours). As it came on I experienced the twitches I have come to call energy tremors, but they smoothed themselves out by peak at 1.5-2 hours. I felt the connection we made was very real, and had the potential to lead to long term bonding (nothing came of our relationship, but that was due to other factors). Overall it was about a 100% perfect trip.
