<P>On Sunday, February 22 I decided, upon awakening, to smoke some 5-MeO-DMT.  I started the day with meditation, and once that was finished retrieved my pipe and materials and went into my living room.  My roommate M and a friend of ours, P, were there.  

<P>I prepared my tools in the same way as before.  I used a slightly larger amount than previous attempts.  As I was getting things ready, my roommate put a cd, Steely Dan's Aja into the cd player.  

<P>I smoked the material in two hits, first melting and vaporizing the 5-MeO and then burning the oregano I was using as a substrate.  Both hits were held approximately 20 seconds.  Before exhaling, I felt the first effects.  I could tell it was more than I had smoked before.

<P>My breathing seemed to slow and deepen and my senses seemed sharpened and ready to recieve data.  Everything around seemed suffused with depth and meaning.  I felt the vibration I have felt before with this material and briefly wondered if it might be the carrier wave of reality.

<P>As I went deeper in my attention was drawn to the music.  Even though I am very familiar with the disc, I was unsure what song was playing.  I did recognize one lyric which made me smile (so what the hell is an angular banjo, anyway?).  It seemed like I was listening to each instrument seperately, but simultaneously.

<P>I felt very "trippy" and altered, but in a way that is hard to define or pin down.  Nothing seemed really different, it just got a lot more intense all of the sudden. After five minutes of this I sat up and discussed it with my companions.  

<P>About this time, I decided to go play frisbee golf with M and P.  To augment this lovely early afternoon, I decided to try some 2CB.  I had been curious what lower doses were like and thought this would be a great opportunity to find out.  But first, I decided to smoke some more 5-MeO.

<P>I guesstimated a dose similar to the first one and smoked it in two hits, the same as before.  Familiar energetic vibrations began pulsing through me.  I lie down and let myself experience what felt like powerful surges of electricity surge through my being.  The ceiling began to undulate and flow.  I moved around in an attempt to align my body with the energies flowing around and through me.  I could almost, but not quite, see them in the air in fron of me.  The results of my adjustments (greater comfort and a sense of rightness about my body state) and the near visuals inspired me to move my arms about in the air on front of me.  I saw definite trails as my arms traced patterns in front of my face. 

<P>After a few minutes I stopped and visualized myself lying on the floor.  In a way that is difficult to explain, this felt very profound.  My visualization seemed charged with mythical/archetypal symbols and power.  When I sat up and looked around everything had an enchanted, magical feel to it.  I have heard this reported with DMT and apparently it is possible on 5-MeO as well.  Everything seemed to have an aura of significance to it.

<P>After coming out of it I spent a moment in reflection and contemplation.  I then prepared my things to leave and washed down 15 mg 2CB with some green tea.  After that, we headed out to the park.

<P>This was my first time playing frisbee golf and I was unsurprisingly bad.  It was still fun to walk around and throw frisbee on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. By the second hole (actually sort of a basket) I was feeling subtle alerts.  I felt a general "loosening" feeling, as if everything had suddenly mellowed out a bit, became more open and easier.  A very nice positive feeling.  As we played the drug effect increased, but it was very subtle compared to 25 mg.  The transition was without discomfort.

<P>Around hole four I asked the time and found an hour had passed.  I stopped to listen to my body and noticed the 2CB was indeed rolling along nicely.  At this level the visual effects were very mild, just a sort of sparkle to everything and the impression of colors from time to time.

<P>Another hole or two farther on we stopped to take a break.  I passed around a jug of green tea and got out my nitrous cracker.  I filled up balloons for both of my companions before enjoying one myself.  

<P>As I inhaled the last of the balloon and the effects were swirling up to surround me I opened my eyes and looked out over the park.  Everything seemed to waver and shimmer and vibrate (a different vibration or frequency than the 5-MeO vibe).  Two people were coming up the hill towards us and the sounds they made seemed to combine with, bounce off of, and be warped by the nitrous into a strange symphony.  It seemed right and I felt totally tuned into everything around me.  I had the distinct impression that everything was as it should be.

<P>After the balloon wore off P produced a pipe and we all took a few hits of cannabis.  This was my first time mixing cannabis with 2CB, and I was curious what effect it would have since I had heard both good and bad things about the combo. 

<P>I would like to note that although we were in public (more or less) we were very discreet about both the balloons and the cannabis.

<P>As we stood up and headed to the next hole I noticed I was really stoned and that my trip had intensified a notch.  About this time we stopped at the "clubhouse" for a drink and I noticed that I was zooming pretty hard.  With everything going on around me (there were a lot of people there) the stimulation was somewhat confusing and threatened to overwhelm me.  I was relieved to go outside again.

<P>Back on the course I marveled at what a truly lovely day it was and noted that walking around throwing frisbee was a great way to spend a low level afternoon trip.  It was spiritually affirming in the way that it reminded me how beatiful life is and how wonderful ordinary days can be.

<P>Before long (T+2 hours) we finished the course.  We met up with another friend in the parking lot and discussed our options for the rest of the afternoon.  We decided to go to lunch and headed to a bar nearby to eat.

<P>In the car on the way over I did another balloon of nitrous.  Again I left my eyes open (I usually close them on nitrous).  I had an interesting realiztion of our (possible) true nature.  I conceived of us an essence that uses our bodies strictly to sense the world around us and communicate and interact with one another.  

<P>At roughly the same time I had another insight into the way that visual stimuli could bind one into a certain mode of dealing with and interpreting reality.  I have long thought that speaking, or listening to someone speak or lyrical music can bind a trip into a certain linguistic modality, and should be avoided (unless that is what you are looking for).  I realized that visual stimuli can and do act in much the same way, and that if they are avoided, it would likely lead to a very different trip. My high dose shroom trips in complete darkness seem to bear this out. After the balloon wore off I felt serenely at peace, a feeling that lasted throughout the rest of the day.

<P>We arrived at our destination, a rather strange bar that is popular here.  Curiously enough, the only other time I have been in there was also while tripping 2CB.  We had lunch and played a couple games of foosball.  Everything tasted great and my appetite was unaffected.

<P>We spent the next hour or so browsing through news stands and print stores.  I had trouble focusing on reading, but the art prints we looked at were very nice.  There were no overt distortions or effects, but things definitely felt enhanced.

<P>We arrived home around 4.5 hours after takeoff.  The sun was starting to get low and everything had a lovely glow to it.  I was still feeling it fairly strong at that time and I was not totally at baseline until I went to bed.

<P>This was very nice.  It was very mellow in most every way.  Overall I prefer 25 mg, but if I had unlimited access to this material (I wish) I might try it at this level on occasion. The marijuana mixed well, enhancing the trip quantitatively and changing it qualitatively in a pleasant way.

<P>One last note.  I am not sure I have mentioned it before, but 2CB seems to enhance my recall of events experienced under its influence.  I can recall many details from all of my 2CB trips, and the memories are very vivid, almost as if I were there. This trip was no exception.

<P>This experiment has only deepened my appreciation of both 5-MeO and 2CB.  A truly lovely experience in most every fashion.
