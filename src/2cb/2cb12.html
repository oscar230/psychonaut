<P>I recently decided to try a combination I had heard many good things about, 2CB plus Ketamine.  When the time came to prepare my materials I found, much to my surprise, that my small supply of Ketamine was gone.   Since only a very few people knew where it was, there was a very small pool of possible suspects.  All of those people are people I thought I could trust.  I was rather upset by this turn of events.

<P>As luck would have it someone had given me a small amount of Ketamine that very night.  It was less than I had planned on using but I figured it would still probably be enough.  I considered aborting my experiment, but finally decided to go ahead.  Although I was upset about what had happened I figured I would be able to move past it and enjoy the experience anyway.

<P>I took twenty five milligrams of 2CB and sat down on the couch to await its onset.  The next thing I knew I was woken up by the CD I had been listening to coming to an end.  I'd slept almost an hour and a half, well into the onset of the bees, but I was feeling nothing.  

<P>At this point, I figured the whole trip was a wash.  I had heard of bees fizzling before and it seemed that it might have finally happened to me.  I decided to wait a little while and see if anything happened.

<P>Almost as soon as I made the decision to give it more time the bees started to become apparent.  The state they put me in was a little odd for the bees. The stimulant aspect was prevalent. I was in sort of a strange place mentally. There wasn't much of a visual aspect to the trip. I really didn't notice any visuals except a vague but definite impression that things looked different. That is to say things definitely looked different than "normal", but I would be hard pressed to say exactly how. In the past I have referred to a psychedelic "gleam". It was that, but also something more.  I felt sort of down and a little out of sorts.

<P>Even still, I decided to press on.  I was down to one of my very last doses of 2CB, with little or no possibility of ever seeing more.  I figured if I had come this far, I might as well go all the way.  

<P>I lined out my Ketamine and snorted the two and a half lines in quick succession.  I think I may have snorted a bit too hard, as it hit the back of my throat with a vengeance and I almost threw up immediately.  I managed to choke it back, turned out the light and lay down to await the show.

<P>A thousand colored motes of light, sparkling slowly into being. All at once they elongate, streaking into the distance, launching me towards some unknown horizon.  I have time for one thought "Oohï¿½this is going to be intense" before I am obliterated, spread out too thin to have thoughts or do anything but observe the new universe unfolding before me.

<P>As before I became a point of consciousness in a seemingly dimensionless space, existing as nothing and everything simultaneously.  Spread out thinly and simultaneously condensed to an incredible density.  I had a sense that what I was experiencing was the true reality, that I was not going to come down into my normal existence.  This sparked a feeling of distant sadness, an awareness that I wasn't quite ready to leave my previous plane of existence for good just yet.

<P>The 2CB seemed to anchor a fragment of identity in the vast K space.  I had a momentary flash of who and what I was from time to time.  Unfortunately I also felt a vague, creeping unease and baseless paranoia throughout the whole experience.  Finding my material stolen left me feeling violated, unsafe in my own house.  This feeling followed me into K space, which was not conducive to the experience I was trying to have at all.

<P>I swirled around in that maddeningly familiar yet utterly alien place for a while, eddying back to the occasional awareness of the room around me and the music I was playing.  As I slowly became more and more cemented in my body I became aware that I didn't feel too hot.  I came to and puked three or four times into a bowl I had prepared for that eventuality.  Afterwards I felt better physically but the feeling of paranoia and unease was strong.  I smoked some pot to banish the lingering nausea, which worked wonders, as usual.

<P>When I was able to do so I got up and looked outside, almost expecting to see someone waiting for me, threatening me.  Of course, there was no one there, it was a usual early morning in my quiet little suburb.  I rested on the living room floor for a little while before realizing I was completely exhausted.  The K killed what was left of the bees, so I was able to sleep almost immediately.

<P>The next day I still felt out of it, ill at ease and unhappy.  I felt a lingering awareness of the Ketamine and it seemed like maybe I had left part of myself in the K space.  This feeling lasted until the next day.  Due to this part of the experience and the fact that someone stole Ketamine from me (no one has ever stolen drugs from me before) I am choosing to abstain from Ketamine for some time, until such time as I feel it is "cleared" of its negative associations in my mind. 

<P>I didn't much enjoy my trip, as impressive as it was.  The whole thing was somewhat of a waste.  In retrospect I definitely should have aborted once I realized that someone had stolen my K.  The negative feelings I went into the trip with suffused it throughout.  I thought the ego release of the K would leave that behind, but it didn't work out that way.  Instead, I simply carried my burden into the altered space with me.
